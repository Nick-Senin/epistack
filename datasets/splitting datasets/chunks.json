I'm happy to go off script. I'm happy to take questions if there's stuff we want to explore at any\nmoment in this. My goal is I'd like to share with you a lot of things that I've learned. Um I'm going to try and make\nthem as actionable as possible. So there is real stuff to do here. Um more than we might in like a more high level talk.\nBut let's be very honest, it is late. It is a lot. It is long. Let's uh let's\ntalk about MCP. I'm hoping that folks here are interested in MCP and that's why you came to this talk. If you're here to learn about MCP, this might be a\nlittle bit of a of a different bent. Just show of hands, heard of MCP,\nused MCP, written in MCP server.\nOkay. Uh, anyone feel uncomfortable with MCP, which is 100% fine. We can tailor.\nOkay, then I would say let's let's just go let's dive in. Um, this is who I am.\nUh, I'm the founder and CEO of a company called Prefect Technologies. For the last seven or eight years, we've been building um data automation software and\norchestration software. Before that, I was a member of the Apache Airflow PMC. Um I originally started Prefect to\ngraduate those same orchestration ideas into data science. Today, we operate the full stack. And then um a few years ago,\nI I developed an agent framework called Marvin, which I would not describe as wildly popular, but it was my leg into\nthe world of AI, at least from a developer experience standpoint, and learned a lot from that. And then more recently, I introduced a piece of\nsoftware called fastmcp, which has is is wildly wildly popular, maybe even too popular. And um hence my status today.\nI'm a little overwhelmed. Uh I find myself back in an open source maintenance seat, which I haven't been in in a few years, which has been a hell\nof a lot of fun. Um but the most important thing is that fastmcp has\ngiven me a very specific vantage point that is really the basis for this talk today. This is our downloads. I've never\nseen anything like this. I've never worked on a project like this. It was downloaded a million and a half times yesterday. Um there's a lot of MVP\nservers out there and um fastp is just it's it's it's become the de facto standard way to build MCP servers. Um I\nintroduced it almost exactly a year ago. As many of you are probably aware, MCP itself was introduced almost exactly a year ago and a few days later I\nintroduced the first version of fast MCP. Uh David atropic uh called me up said I think this is great. I think this\nis how people should build servers. We put a version of it into the official SDK which was amazing. And then as um as\nMCP has gone crazy in the last year, we found it actually to be constructive to\nposition fast MCP uh as I'm maintaining it as the highle interface to the MCP\necosystem while the SDK SDK focuses on the low-level primitives and actually ",

It's become a little\nbit of it's it's too confusing that there are these two things called fast MCP. So fast MTP will be a highle\ninterface to the world and um as a result we see a lot of um not great MCP\nservers. I I named the talk after this meme and then it occurred to me like do people even know what this meme is\nanymore? Like this this to me is very funny and very topical and then it's from like a 1999 episode of Futurama. So\nif you haven't seen this, my talk's title is not meant to be mean. I'm sort\nof an optimist. I choose to interpret this as but you can do better. And so we're going to find ways to do better.\nThat is the goal of today's talk. In fact, to be more precise, what I want to do today is I would really like to build\nan intuition for a gentic product design. Um I don't see this talked about nearly as much as it should be given how\nmany agents are using how many products today. And what I mean by this is the exact analog of what it would be if I\nwere if I were giving a talk on how to just build a good product for a user, for a human. And we would talk about\nhuman interface guidelines and we talk about user experience and we talk about stories. And I found it really instructive to start talking about those\nthings from an agentic perspective because what else is an MCP server but an interface um for an agent and we\nshould design it for the strengths and weaknesses of those agents in the same way that we do everything else. Now when\nI put this thought in the world I very very very frequently get this push back which is but if a human can use an API\nwhy can't an AI and there are so many things wrong with this question and the number one thing that's wrong with this question is that it has a assumption\nthat I see in so much of AI product design and it drives me nuts which is that AIs are perfect or they're oracles\nor they're good at everything and they are very very very powerful tools but I'm assuming based on your responses\nbefore. I think everyone in this room has some scars of the fact that they are fallible or they are limited or you know\nthey're imperfect. And so I don't like this question because it presumes that they're like magically amazing at everything. But I really don't like this\nquestion. This is a literal question I've got and I didn't paraphrase it. I really don't like this question because humans don't use APIs. Very very rarely\ndo humans use APIs. Humans use products. We do anything we can to put something\nbetween us and an API. We put a website. we put an SDK, we put a client, we put a\nmobile app. We we do not like to use APIs unless we have to or we are the person responsible for building um that\ninterface. And so one of my core arguments um and why I love MCP so much is that I believe that agents deserve\ntheir own interface that is optimized for them and uh their own use case. And\nin order to design that interface, which i",

    "text": "s what I want to motivate today, uh we have to think a little bit about what is\nthe difference between a human and an AI. And it's one of these questions that's like sounds really stupid when you say it out loud, but it's\ninstructive to actually go through. And I'd like to make the argument to you that it exists on these three um\ndimensions of discovery, iteration, and context. And so just to begin, humans,\nwe find discovery really cheap. We tend to do it once. If you think if if any of you have had to implement something\nagainst a REST API, what do you do? You call up the docs or you go in Swagger, whatever it is, you call it up, you look\nat it one time, you figure out what you need, you're never going to do that again. And so, while it may take you some time to do the discovery, it is\ncheap in the lifetime of the application you are building. AIS, not so much.\nEvery single time that thing turns on, it shakes hands with the server. It learns about the server. It enumerates\nevery single tool and every single description on that server. So discovery is actually really expensive for agents.\nIt consumes a lot of tokens. Um, next, iteration. Same idea. If you're a human\ndeveloper and you're writing code against an API, you can iterate really quickly. Why? Because you do your\none-time discovery. You figure out the three routes you're going to call and then you write a script that calls them\none after another as fast as your language allows. So iteration is really cheap. And if that doesn't work, you\njust run it again until it does. Iteration is cheap. is fast. Um for agents, I think we all know iteration is\nslow. Iteration is the enemy. Every additional call um subject to your caching setup also sends the entire\nhistory of all previous co calls over the wire. Like it is just you do not want to iterate if you can avoid it. And so that's going to be an important thing\nthat we take into consideration. And the last thing is on context. And this is a little bit handwavy, but it is important\nas humans in this conversation. I'm talking, you're hearing me, and you're comparing this to different memories you\nhave and different experiences you have on different time scales, and it's all doing wonderful, amazing things in your brain. And when you plug an LLM uh into\nany um given use case, it remembers the last 200,000 tokens it saw. And that's the extent of its um memory plus\nwhatever is, you know, embedded somewhere in its in its weights and that's it. And so we need to be very\nvery conscious of the fact that it has a very small brain at this moment. I I think it is a lot closer to when people\ntalk about sending, you know, Apollo 11 to the moon and and with like 1 kilobyte of RAM, whatever it was. I think that's\nactually how we need to think about these things that frankly feel quite magical because they go and uh open my\nPRs for me or whatever it is that they do. Um, so these are the three key dimensions in my mind of what is\ndifferent and we should not build ",

    "text": "APIs that are good for humans on any of these\ndimensions and pretend that they are also good for agents. And one way that I've kind of started talking about this\nis this idea which is an agent can find a needle in a hay stack. The problem is it's going to look at every piece of hay\nand decide if it's a needle. And that's like not literally true, but it is in an\nintuitive sense how we should think about what we're putting in front of the agents and how we're posing a problem. And an MCP server is nothing but an\ninterface to that problem andor solution. And so finally to go back to our product intuition statement, I\nargued to you that the most important word in the universe for MCP developers is curate. How do you curate from a huge\namount of information which might be amenable for a human developer a\ninterface that is appropriate for one of these extremely limited AI agents at least on the dimensions that we just\nwent through. Um, and that sort of brings us to this slide, YMCP. And I almost made this like the Derek\nZoolander slide like but why MCP? Like but I just told you why MCP Derek. It's because it does all of these things. It\ngives us a standard way of communicating uh information to agents in a way that's controllable where we can control not\nonly how it's discovered but also how it is acted on. There's a big asterisk on that because client implementations in\nthe MCP space right now are not amazing and they do some things that are themselves not compliant with the MCP\nspec. Maybe at the end we'll get into that. It's not directly relevant to now except\nthat all we can do is try to build the best servers we can subject to the limitations of the clients that will use\nthem. And again, I put this in here. I think we don't need to go through uh what MCP is for this audience. So, we're\ngoing to move quickly through this. But it is, of course, for the for the for the sake of the transcript, the cliche\nis that it's USBC uh for the internet. It is a standard way to connect LLMs and\neither tools or um data. And if you haven't seen fast MCP, this is what it\nlooks like to build a fully fully functional MCP server. This one, I live\nin Washington DC. the subway is often on fire there and so this checks whether or not the subway is on fire and um indeed\nit is. Now the question we are here to actually explore is why are there so\nmany bad MCP servers? Maybe a better question is do you all agree with me that there are many bad\nMCP servers? I sort of declare this as if it's true. I I'm not trying to make a controversial statement. There are many\nbad MCP servers in the world. I see a lot of them because people are using my framework to build them. It does that\nsurprise anyone that I'm sort of declaring that I'm genuinely I'm I'm curious if that's a if I'm made an\nassumption. I don't in my experience I I won't say every every MCB I I came\nup to is like that but a lot of them are like AI rubbers. They just put a like\nstringify the content of the API and that's an",

And I and I think even I'll I'll make the argument going a little off script here, but I'll make the argument that a lot of them even when they're not\nrappers are just bad products because no thought was put into them. And I mean,\nuh, one comparison that that I talk about sometimes with my team is if you go to a a bad website, you know it's a\nbad website. We don't need to sit there and figure out why it's it's ugly or it's hard to use or it's hard to find what you're looking for or it's all\nflash. I don't know. I don't know what makes a bad website exactly, but you know what a bad website is when you go to one. Um, we don't like to point out\nall the things because there's an infinite number of them. Instead, we try to find great examples of good websites. And so, what I think we need more than\nanything else are MCP best practices. And so, a big push of mine right now and part of where this talk came from is I\nwant to make sure that we have as many best practices in the world and documented. And I do want to applaud there are a few firms um these are\nscreenshots from uh Block has an amazing playbook which if you hate this talk read their read their blog post it's\nit's like a better version of what I'm doing right now and GitHub recently put out one and many other companies have\ndone as well. I I could have I could have put a lot here but um these are two that I've referred to uh quite\nfrequently and so I I recommend them to you. Um the block team in particular is just phenomenal what they're doing on\nMCP. By coincidence, the same team has been my customer for six years on the data\nside and they're I really love the work that they do and um the blog posts they put out are very thoughtful and I highly\nhighly recommend them to you. Um I want to see more of this and today is sort of one of my humble efforts to try and put\nsome of that in the world. And so what I thought we would do today because I did not want to ask you to open your laptops\nup and set up environments and actually write code with me because it's 4:25 on Saturday. Um, I thought\nthat we would fix a server together sort of through slides um to make this again as I said hopefully actionable but um\nbut a gentle a gentle approach to this. And so here is here is the server that you were describing a moment ago. Right.\nSo someone wrote this server um I hope that the notation is is clear enough to folks. We have we have a decorator that\nsays that a function is a tool and then we have the tool itself. And forgive me I didn't bore you with the with the\ndetails because we think this is a bad server to begin with. Um I think in this server what's our example here right we\nwant to we want to check an order status and so in order to check an order status we need to learn a lot of things about the user and uh what their orders are we\nneed to filter it we need to actually check the status and if this were a REST API which presumably it is we know\nexactly what we",

And instead, if we expose this to an agent, what order is it going to call these in?\nDoes it know what the format of the arguments are? How long is it going to take for the minimum three round trips\nthis is going to require? These are all the problems that we're exposing just just by looking at this. We're not I mean solve them, but that's the problems\nI see if I were reviewing this as a product facing um effort. And so the\nfirst thing that we are going to think about and I think this is probably the most important thing when we think about\nan effective MCP server because it is product thinking is outcomes not operations. What do we want to achieve?\nAnd this is a little bit annoying for engineers sometimes because it's forced\nproduct thinking. It's not someone coming along with a user story and and mapping it all out and saying this is\nwhat we need to implement. We cannot put something in this server unless we know for a fact it's going to be useful and\nhave a good outcome. We have to start there. There's just not enough context for us to uh be frivolous. And so here's\nkind of what this feels like so that we can get a sense for it. Um the trap when\nyou're falling into the trap, you have a whole bunch of atomic operations. This\nis amazing if you're building a REST API. It is best practice if you're building a REST API. It is bad if you're\nbuilding an MCP server. Instead, we want things like track latest order and give an email. It's hard to screw up and you\nknow what the outcome is when you call it. Um, the other version of the trap is agent as glue or agent as orchestrator.\nUm, please believe me since I've spent my career building orchestration software and automation software that\nthere are things that are really good at doing orchestration and there are things that are really bad at orchestration and agents are right in the middle because\nthey can do it but it's expensive and slow and annoying and hard to debug and stochastic. And so if you can avoid\nthat, please do. If you can't, there are times when you don't know the algorithm and you don't know how to write the code and it's not programmatic, that's a\nperfect time to use an LLM as an orchestrator. Finding out an order status, really bad time, really\nexpensive time to choose to use an LLM as your orchestration service. So don't um instead focus on this sort of one\ntool equals one agent story. And again, even here, we're trying to introduce a new vocabulary. It's not a user story\nbecause user stories everyone thinks human even though it is a user. It's an agent story. It's something that a\nprogrammatic autonomous agent with an objective and a limited context window is trying to achieve and we need to\nsatisfy that as much as we can. And then this is one of",

    "text": " those like little tips that feels obvious but I think is\nimportant. Name the tool for the agent. Don't name it for you. It's not a REST API. It's not supposed to be clear to\nfuture developers who need to write, you know, you're not writing an API for change. You're writing an API so that the agent picks the right tool at the\nright time. Don't be afraid about using silly but um explanatory names for your\ntools. I shouldn't say silly. Um they might feel a little silly, but they're very userf facing in this moment, even\nthough it feels like a deep a deep d a deep API. Um this uh just in case any of\nyou didn't go read the block blog post. Uh I just found this section of it so uh\nimportant where they essentially say something very similar. designed top down from the workflow, not bottom up\nfrom the API endpoints. Two different ways to get to the same place, but they will result in very different forms of\nproduct thinking and very different MCP server. So again, I just I really encourage you to go and take a look at\nthat at that blog post. And if we were to go back to that bad code example I showed you a moment ago and start\nrewriting this and if we had our laptops, you're welcome to have your laptops out and follow along. The code will essentially run, but there's no\nneed. Um, here's what that could look like. We did the thing that you would do as a human. We made three calls in\nsequence that are configured that are to our API, but we buried them in one agentf facing tool. And that's how we\nwent from operations to outcomes. The the API calls still have to happen. There's no magic happening here. But the\nquestion is, are we going to ask an agent to figure out the outcome and how to stitch them together to achieve it or\nare we going to just do it because we know how to how to do it on its behalf. So thing number one is outcomes over\noperations. Thing number two, another thing, a lot of these frankly are going to seem kind of silly actually when I say them out loud.\nPlease just trust me from the download graph that these are the most important things that I could offer as advice. And uh if and if none of them apply to you,\nthink of yourself as in the top 1% of MCP developers. Flatten your arguments. Um\nI see this so often where I do this myself. I'll confess to you where you say uh here's my tool and one of the\ninputs is a configuration dictionary hopefully presumably it's documented\nsomewhere in maybe in the agents instructions maybe it's in the doc string um you have a real problem when\nby the way I I don't remember if I have a point for this later so I'll say it now uh a very frequent trap that you can\nfall into with arguments that are complex is you'll put the explanation of how to use them in something like a\nsystem prompt or a sub aent definition or something like that and then you'll change the tool in the server and now\nyou it's almost worse than a poorly documented tool.

Now you could\nask what if it's a pyantic model with every field annotated and fine that's\nbetter than the dictionary but it's still going to be hard. There was until\nvery recently there may still be a bug in maybe it's not a bug because no one seems to fix it but in cloud desktop all\num all structured arguments like object arguments would be sent as a string and\nthis created a real problem um because we do not want to support automatic\nstring conversion to object but clog desktop is one of the most popular MCP clients and so we actually bowed to this\nin as a matter of like necessity and So fastmcp will now try if you are supplying a string argument to something\nthat is very clearly a structured object, it will try to des serialize it. It will try to do the right thing. I really hate that we have to do that.\nThat feels very deeply wrong to me that we have a a type schema that said I need an object and yet we're doing clutchy\nstuff like that. And so this is an example of where this is an evolving ecosystem. It's a little um it's a\nlittle messy, but what does it look like when you do it right? Top level primitives. These are the arguments into the function. What's the limit? What is\nthe status? What is the email? Clearly defined. Just like naming your tool for the agent, name the arguments for the\nagent. Um, and here's sort of what that looks like when we get that into code. Instead of having config colon dict, we\nhave an email, which is a string. We have include cancelled, which is a a flag. And then I highly highly recommend\nliterals or enums whenever you can. Um, much better than a string if you know what the options are. uh at this time\nvery few LLMs know that this kind of syntax is supported and so they would typically write this if you had claude\ncode or something write this. It would usually write format colon string equals basic which works. It just doesn't know\nto do this. And so it's one of those little little actionable tips. Use literal or use enum equivalently. When\nyou have a a constrained choice um your your agent will thank you. And I do have\ninstructions or context. So, I did get ahead of myself. I'm sorry everybody. It is 4:35 on a Saturday. Um, the next\nthing though I want to talk about is the instructions that you give to the agent. Um, this cuts both ways. Um, the most\nobvious way is when you have none. Uh, we mentioned that a moment ago. If you don't tell your agent how to use your\nMCP server, it will guess. It will try. Um, it will probably confuse itself and\nall of those guesses will show up in its history and that's not a great outcome. Um, please document your MCP server.\nDocument the server itself. Document all the tools on it. Um, uh, give examples.\nExamples are a little bit of a double-edged sword. Um, on the one hand, they're extremely helpful for showing\nthe",

Perhaps as models improve, it will stop doing that. But uh in my experience, if you have an\nexample, let's say you have a field for tags. You want to you want to collect tags for something. If your example has two tags, you will never get 10 tags.\nYou will get two tags pretty much every time. They'll be accurate. It's not going to do a bad job, but it really\nuses those examples um for a lot more dimensions than just the fact that they work if that makes sense. So, so use\nexamples, but be careful with your examples. Yes, sir. Giving out of distribution examples as a\nway to solve for that. Have you seen that by out of distribution? Do you mean\nthat are not would not be representative of bacter? It's so interesting. So um I don't have\na strong opinion on that. That seems super reasonable to me. I don't have an opinion on it. I in my experience the\nfact that an example has some implicit pattern like the number of objects in array is becomes such a strong signal\nthat I almost gave this its own bullet point called examples are contracts. like if you give one expect to get\nsomething like it out of distribution is a really interesting way to sort of fight against I guess that inertia I\nwould imagine it is better to do it that way I would just be careful of falling into this sort of more base layer trap I\nthink so that's completely reasonable and I would endorse it I think this is just a more broad whatever example you\nput out there weird quirks of it will show up I I on an MCP server that I'm building I encountered this tag thing\njust uh yesterday and it really confused me no matter how much I was like, \"Use at least 10 tags.\" It always was two.\nAnd I finally figured it was because one of my examples had had two tags. Um, so yes, good strategy. May or may not be\nenough to overcome these basic these basic caveats. Um,\noh, I do have examples of contracts. I'm sorry. It's We're 37. Um, this one I\nthink is one of the most interesting things on this slide. Uh, errors are prompts. So, um,\nevery response that comes out of the tool, your your LLM doesn't know that it's\nit's like bad. It's not like it gets a 400 or a 500 or something like that. It gets what it sees as information about\nthe fact that it didn't uh succeed in what it was attempting to do. And so if\nyou just allow Python in in fastmcp's case or whatever your tool of choice is to raise for example an empty value\nerror or a cryptic MCP error with an integer code that's the information that goes back to your LLM and does it know\nwhat to do with it or not probably it knows at least to retry because it knows it was an error but you actually have an\nopportunity to document your API through errors and this leads to some\ninteresting strategies that I don't want to wholeheartedly endorse but I will mention where for example if you do have a complex API because you can'",

Then instead of documenting every possibility in the dock string\nthat that documents the entire tool, you might actually document how to recover from the most common failures. And so\nit's a very weird form of progressive disclosure of information where you are acknowledging that it is likely that\nthis agent will get its first call wrong, but based on how it gets it wrong, you actually have an opportunity to send more information back in an\nerror message. Um, as I said, this is a kind of a not an amazing way to think about building software, but it is the\nultimate version of what I'm recommending, which is be as helpful as possible in your error messages. Do go overboard. They become part of, as far\nas the agent is concerned, its next prompt. And so, they do matter. Um, if they are too aggressive or too scary, it\nmay avoid the tool permanently. It may decide the tool is inoperable. Um, so\nerrors really matter. And I don't think this needs too much of an explanation, but this is what it looks like when you\nhave a full dock string and an example, etc. Um, uh, block uh, in their blog\npost makes a point which I haven't seen used too widely, although chatbt does take advantage of this in their\ndeveloper mode, which is this readonly hint. So the MCP spec has support for\num, annotations, which is a restricted subset of annotations that you can place on various components. One of them for\ntools is whether or not it's readon. And if you supply this optionally, clients\ncan choose to treat that tool a little bit differently.

And uh I don't know who here is a fan of d- yolo or d-dangerous\ndisable permissions or whatever whatever they're called in different in different terminals, but then you don't care about this. But for example, chat GBT will ask\nyou for extra permission if a tool does not have this annotation set because it presumes that it can take a side effect\nand can um have an adverse effect. So use those to your advantage. It is one\nother form of design that the client can choose to provide a better experience with.\nI've talked about this a bit now. Respects the token budget. Um,\nI think the meme right now is that the GitHub server ships like 200,000 tokens when you handshake with it, something\nlike that. Um, this is a real thing. And I don't think it makes the GitHub server automatically bad. I think it's actually\nmakes it endemic on folks like myself who build frameworks and folks who build clients to find ways to actually solve\nthis problem because the answer can't always be do less. In fact, right now we want to do more. We want an abundance of\nfunctionality. And so we'll talk about that maybe a little bit later. Um, but respect for the token budget really\nmatters. It is a very scarce resource and your server is not the only one that the agent is going to talk to. So, uh, I\nwas on a call with a customer of mine recently who ",

I won't say who they are, but I really respect them. and they got on the\ncall and they were so excited and they were like, \"We're in the process of converting our stuff to MCP so that we can use it.\" And they had a a strong\nargument why it actually had to be their API. So that's not even the punch line of the story, which is a whole other story in in and of itself, but it\nfundamentally came down to this. They had 800 endpoints that had to be exposed to which I had this thought, which if by\nthe time you finish reading this, this is the token budget for each of those 800 tools. if you assume 200,000 um um\ntokens in the context window. So if each of those 800 tools had only this much space to document itself, not even\ndocument itself, share its schema, share its name plus documentation, this is the\namount of space you would get. And when you were done taking up this space because you were so careful and each tool really fit in this, you would\nlobomize the agent on handshake because it would have no room for anything else. So the token budget really matters. um\nif this agent connected to a server with one more tool that had a one-word dock string, it would just fail. It would\njust have a over effectively an overflow, right? So, the token budget matters. Um there is probably a budget\nthat's appropriate for whatever work you're doing. You may know what it is, you may not know what it is. Pretend you know what it is and be mindful of it. Um\nin a worst case scenario, try to be parsimmonious. Try to be as efficient as possible. That's why we do experiments\nlike sending additional instructions in the error message. It's one way to save on the token budget on handshake. And\nthe handshake is painful. Um I'm not sure folks know that uh when an when an\nLLM connects to an NCP server, it typically does download all the descriptions in one go so that it knows\nwhat's available to it. And it's usually not done in like a progressively disclosed way. That is done outright.\nYes. Uh absolutely.\nfacive\ndisclosure mechanisms where when it first initializ\ndescribe step for each one. So it's 95% less context window\nand then whatever service it doesn't actually expose that to the unless it needs\nthat's okay. So that's that's awesome. Let's let's talk about this idea for one second because it's a really interesting design. Um,\nthere's a debate right now about what you can do that's compliant with the spec versus what you do that's not\ncompliant with the spec. And as long as you do things that are compliant with the spec, then then by all means do them. Who cares? One of the problems is\nthat there are clients that are not compliant with a spec. Cloud Desktop is one of them. I've mentioned it a few times. I have a history with Cloud\nDesktop. Um, Cloud Desktop hashes all of ",

It doesn't care about the fact that the spec allows you to send more\ninformation. I think your solution would get around this because it's a tool call. But um many of the first attempts\nthat people use to use spec compliant techniques for getting around this problem such as notifications fail in\ncloud desktop. Usually you failed before this in cloud desktop. I'm not a fan of cloud desktop\nfrom MCP server. I think it's a real missed opportunity because it is such a flagship product of the company that has introduced MCP. I think it's a real\nmissed opportunity. Cloud code is great. um uh it it caches everything in SQLite\ndatabase so it like doesn't matter uh what you do um techniques similar to what you've described where you provide\nmechanisms for learning more about a tool that's a great idea I really like that um there is a challenge where now\nyou are back in a sort of flatten arguments world because you have met tools now where I need to use tools to\nlearn about tools and use to tools to call tools in some extreme cases or beyond so you need to design this very\ncarefully that's why it usually does show up as a dedicated ated product. So thank you for sharing that. Um uh there\nare many really interesting techniques for trying to solve this problem. Yes. So you talk about um progressive\ndisclosure. Do you use um masking? So for example, I connect to my Kubernetes\nserver and my credentials only give me certain rights. So therefore there are\n28 tools that I don't have access to. So therefore, you don't need to do that. So\nwhen you say do I do I support that? Do you mean does MCP support that or do I in my product support that? Yeah, I was just asking something I've\nread about.\nOkay. So so the spec makes no claim about this. The spec says when you call list tools you get tools back and how\nthat happens is is up to up to implementation. Um, fast MCP makes that\nan overridable hook through middleware, but again makes no claim on how that is.\nPrefix commercial products, which I'm not here to pitch, allow per tool masking on any basis. And we see that as\nlike a place to have an opinionated in the commercial landscape as opposed to an opinion in the open source landscape as opposed to the protocol which should\nhave no opinion at all. So if that's interesting, we can chat about this. You might be getting into this but if you\ntake this problem the example J might have mentioned kind of table of contents approach guess approach is what split\nover the four different chunks or maybe the 800 don't all justify having their own server like what was the solution\nfor them they can't do it they there's no solution that allowed them to have as much information as they wanted on the\non the contact center window they have they didn't need it they didn't need it um and and it became a design question\nand and frankly it was this call was probably four months ago",

Um, which made me realize we need to have talks more like this and just talk about what it is to\ndesign a product for an agent. My worry is MCP is viewed as infrastructure or a\ntransport technology and it is and I'm very excited. I think by a year from now we will be talking about context\nproducts as opposed to MCP servers. I'm very excited about that. We'll move past the transport. Um but we need to figure\nout how to use it and so so I think that's how we talk about it. Um the only other alternative that I have discussed\nwith a few folks a few companies when you have a problem like this is if you control the client\nmuch more interesting things become available to you. Um if you can instruct your client to do things a certain way\nfor example if you have a mobile app that presents an agentic interface to an end user you control the client is what I mean by that. um or if it's internal\nand you can dictate what what client or what custom client a team uses. Now you\ncan do much more interesting things because you actually do know a lot more about that token budget and how to\noptimize it. But for an external facing server, there's not a good there's not a good solution.\nI think by now we have talked through all of this. So I'll leave it for uh posterity uh in the interest of time.\nUm, we talked about curate as a key verb earlier in this talk. Um, it is, I would\nargue, what we have been doing in each of these little vignettes that we've been working through with the code. We\nare curating the same information set down to one that is more amendable and more recognizable for an agent. Um, 50\ntools is where I draw the line where you're going to have performance problems. I think it seems really low to\na lot of people. Some people will talk about it even lower than that. Some people might talk about it higher. If you have more than 50 tools on a server\nwithout knowing anything else about it, I'm going to start to think that it's not a great server. Um, the GitHub\nserver has, I think, 170 tools. Does that mean it's not a great server? No. There's a good argument there. And the\nGitHub team has put out a lot of really interesting blog posts on semantic routing that they're doing. They had one just yesterday actually on like some\ninteresting techniques they're using. Um, uh, there's software like, um, like the one you mentioned a moment ago, sir,\nwhich which helps with this problem. So having a lot of tools like that does not automatically make it a bad server, but\nit is a smell and it does make me wonder, can we split them up? Do you have admin tools mixed in with user\ntools? Could we name space these tools differently? Would it be worthwhile having two servers instead of one? Um,\nthat is a little bit of a smell. If you can get down to 515, that would be ideal. I know that's not achievable for most people. So it's one of those\nactionable but maybe not so actionable little tips. It's an aspir",

It's 50 tools to the agent is where you start to see\nperformance degradation. Um, I love this. Um, Kelly KFl is someone who I've\nknown a long time. He's at Fiverr now. And while I was putting this talk together, I happened to come across these two blog posts of his, which are a\nlittle bit of like a shot and a chaser. They're written almost exactly a month apart. One's from October, one's from November. In the first one, he talks\nabout building up a Fiverr server, and he goes from a couple of basic tools to uh I think 155 188. And in the second\nblog post, he talks about how he curated that server from 188 down to five. You could read either of these blog posts.\nYou could view them independently as a success story on what his adventure was in learning MCP. I think taken together\nthey tell a really interesting story about making something work and then making something work well which is of\ncourse the product journey in some sense. Um and so where this where this\ntakes us is sort of the thing that I sorry do you have a question? Oh sorry\num where this takes us is sort of the thing that I have found is the most like obvious version of this. I wrote a blog\npost that went a little bit viral on this, which is why I talk about it a lot, which is please, please just, if nothing else, stop converting REST APIs\ninto MCP servers. It is the fastest way to violate every single thing we've talked about today, every single one of\nthe heristics that we laid out about agents. Um, it really doesn't work. And, it's really complicated because this is\nthe fastm documentation. That's a blog post I had to write. And the blog post basically says, I know I introduced the\ncapability to do this. Please stop. That's a really complicated thing. That's that could be a workshop in and\nof itself. Um, I do bear a little bit of responsibility here. This is not just a feature of FastMPP. It's one of the most\npopular features of FastMPP, which is why candidly it's not going anywhere. And instead, we're going to document\naround that fact. Um, but here's the problem, right? Uh, you just you can't\nyou just can't you just can't convert I'm not going to explain it. you just can't convert rests into dev speed server but\nit is an amazing way to bootstrap. Um when you are trying to figure out if\nsomething is working do not write a lot of code where you introduce new ways to figure out if you have failed. Do start\nby picking a couple of key endpoints mirroring them out with fastmcp's\nautoconverter or any other tool you like or even just write that code yourself.

Um, just don't\nend up ship the REST API to prod as an MCP server. You will regret it. You will pay for it. um a little bit later even\nthough there's a dopamine hit up front. So um these are the five major things\nthat we talked about today in our pseudo workshop workshop that wasn't really a\nworkshop actionable talk. Um outcomes, not operations. Focus on the workflow. Focus on the top down. Don't get caught\nup in all the little operations. Don't ask your agent to be an orchestrator unless you absolutely have to. Um\nflatten your arguments. Try not to ship large payloads. Try not to confuse the agent. Try not to give it too much choice. I don't think I said out loud\nwhen we talked about that, but try not to have tightly coupled arguments. That really confuses the agent. Um, see if you can uh design around that. Uh, if\npossible, it's not always possible, but if you can, um, instructions are context. Seems obvious to say out loud. Of course\nthey are. They're information for it. Use them as context. Design them as context. Really put thought into your\ninstructions the same way as you would into your tool signature and schema. Respect the token budget.

Start with what works and then\njust tear it down to the essentials. Um I I have been writing MCP servers about\nas long as anyone at this point. um a year and I still find myself starting by\nputting too many tools in the world sometimes because I'm not sure which one it will use or or I'm experimenting and\nI have to I have to remind myself to go back and get rid of them and it and it's hard I think as an engineer especially\ndesigning normal APIs you're like okay like here's my tool here's v2 is backwards compatible right like and you\nkeep it you keep adding stuff and that's a really natural way to work and it can be a best practice and uh it doesn't\nwork here you are It would be like using a UI that just showed a REST API to a to a user. Um, this is this is a criticism\nI have offered of my own products at times when I'm like this looks a little bit too much like our REST API docs,\nright?

And happy to take any question if there are any.\nWhat are typically? Um that would be where you have one argument that's like um what is the file\ntype and another argument that's like how should we process the file and your input to the file type argument\ndetermines the valid inputs for the other argument. So they're they're now tightly coupled. Some some arguments on\nthe second thing are invalid depending on what you said for the first thing. It's just one extra thing to keep track of. That's a good question. Sorry I\ndidn't define that. Do you have a question? I have to I will start with the first one. uh\nwhen you are giving like an agent an entity server you have to like document the tools or or the the capabilities of\nthe server in the server and in the agent and that is like uh not ideal. So\nwhat what would you recommend that or only in the server? So this this comes down to do you\ncontrol the client or not? If you control the client then this is a real choice and there are uh there are\ndifferent ways to think about it. So, um, for example, in some of my stuff that I write that I know I'm using, for\nexample, cloud code to access, um, I might actually document my MCP server as, um, files or cloud skills because I\nknow what the workflows are going to be. I know that some of my workflows are infrequent and I don't want to pollute\nthe context space with them. So, if you if you control the client, you you have a real choice to make there. If you\ndon't control the client, then you don't have so much of a choice. have to document it here because you have to assume you're you're working with the\nworst possible client. Um, honestly, many of the answers in MCP\nspace boil down to do you control the client? Then you can do really interesting things on both sides of the protocol. From a server author\nperspective, you really do need to document everything in its dock string. The one escape hatch is that you can\ndocument a server itself. So every server has an instructions field. Um, it is not respected by every client.\nI believe my team has filed bugs where we have determined that to be the case.\nUm, so hopefully that's not a permanent thing, but most clients will on handshake download not only the tools\nand resources and everything, but a instructions blob for the se",

Yes, this I know a lot about.\nIt's going to it's it's it's going to expand. It's not actually going to change so much because of the way it's implemented. Um uh what question could I\nanswer like what is it? Am I excited about it? I am excited about it. Um so\nall the rules still apply. That's a that is a fantastic question. Let's talk about this for one second. Um some of you I don't know if any of you were at a\nmeetup we hosted last night where my colleague actually gave a presentation on Oh, you were. Yes, that's right.\nI was like I know at least somebody's coming. Um uh my colleague Adam gave a very good talk on this which I can we'll\nchat after this. I'll I'll send you a link to um to a recording of it. Um but the nutshell version is this is this is\nuh SEP 1686 uh is the name of the proposal and it adds asynchronous background tasks to\nthe MCP protocol not just for tools but for every operation. Um and we don't\nneed to talk about too much about what that is. The reason it doesn't involve changes to any of these rules is um this\nis essentially an optin mode of operating in which the client is saying I want this to be run asynchronously and\ntherefore the client takes on new responsibilities about checking in on it and and and polling for the result and\nactually collecting the result but the actual interface of learning about the tool or calling the tool etc is exactly\nthe same as it is today. So this is fully opt-in on the client side. Um and that's why from a design standpoint,\nnothing changes. The only question from a server designer um standpoint is is\nthis an appropriate thing to be backgrounded as opposed to be done, you know, synchronously on the server. Um or\nsorry, let me take that back. You can background anything because it's a Python framework. So you can chuck anything in a Python framework. The\nquestion is should the client wait for it or not? Should it be a blocking task is really the is really the the right\nvocabulary for this? Um, and that's a that's just a design question for the server maintainer.\nIs that am I in the the the zone of what you were looking for?\nOh, no kidding.\nL Very. Yes, this happens a lot actually and\nbut until you said this, I didn't think of it as like a pattern, but I've seen this a lot. It's a real problem. Maybe we'll write a write a blog post on\nit. That would be fun. Um, yes,\nthe rules still apply. But as far as elicitation is concerned, how do you do that in terms of\nuh elicitation is really interesting. So, um, now we're in advanced",

    "text": " MCP elicitation. Anyone not familiar with\nwhat that is? Yes. So elicitation is basically a way to ask the client for\nmore input halfway through a tool execution. So you take your initial arguments for the tool, you do an\nelicitation. It's a formal NCP request and you say, \"I need more information.\" And it's uh structured is what's kind of\ncool about it. So the most common use case of this in clients that support it is for approvals where you say I need a\nyes or no of whether I can proceed on maybe it's some irreversible side effect or something like that. Um when it works\nit works amazingly. Again it's one of those things that doesn't have amazing client support and therefore a lot of\npeople don't put in their servers because it'll break your server if you send out this thing and the client doesn't know how what to do with it. So\nyou got to be a little bit careful. Does it change the design is a fantastic question. I wish it were used more so I\ncould say yes and you should depend on it. If all clients supported it and it was widely used and the reason all clients don't support this one, by the\nway, I'm not trying to it's not like a meme that clients are bad. It's complicated to know how to handle elicitation because some clients are\nuserfacing. Then it's super easy. Just ask the user and give them a form. Some clients are automated, some are\nbackgrounded, some and so what you do with an elicitation is actually kind of complicated. if you just fill it in as an LLM,\nmaybe you satisfied it, maybe you didn't. It's it's a little tough to know. So, if it were widely used, I\nwould say absolutely. It gives you an opportunity to put in particular tightly coupled arguments into an elicitation\nprompt. Um, or confirmations. Um, a lot of times you'll see for destructive tools, you'll see confirm and it'll\ndefault to false and you're forcing the LLM to acknowledge at least as a way of, you know, hopefully tipping it into a\nmore sane operating mode. Elicitation is a better way to design for that. I didn't I don't think that made it into\nthis in any of these examples. So, great question. Wish I could say yes. I hope to say yes. How about that?

Do you\nagree that the MCPS are like I do not needed there or do you have like a\nI do I I think um I would not I would not tell you to\nwrite an MCP server. I think that within a year the reason you would choose to write MCP server is because you'll get\nbetter observability and uh understanding of what failed whereas the\nagent frameworks are not great because part of the whole agent framework's job is to not fail on tool call and actually\nsurface it back to the LLM similar to what we were talking about a moment ago.

We\ndidn't we at first didn't want to put it in fastmcp main because we weren't sure fastcp tries to be opinionated and we\nweren't sure how to fit that in and then actually it was so successful that we decided we're going to add an experiments\nflag to the CLI and have it but I don't know if it's in yet\nh\nYeah, this will go into this new I forget if we called it experiments or optimize is it's on our road map right\nnow and this would this would go in there.

Вероятно, простых ответов здесь нет, но как бы то ни было, мы впервые получили нечто отличное от нас, очень\nпохожее на нас, во всяком случае, в отношении поговорить практически на любые темы. Не ведёт ли отсюда от\nискусственных нейронных сетей и искусственного интеллекта дорога или, по крайней мере, тропинка к лучшему\nпониманию того, как устроен наш интеллект и наше сознание. У меня в\nгостях сегодня Константин Владимирович Анохин. Добро пожаловать в программу.\nДобрый вечер. Здравствуйте. Константин Владимирович, доктор медицинских наук, профессор,\nдиректор института перспективных исследований мозга Московского государственного университета и академик\nРоссийской академии наук. И вы много изучали сознания и знаете о нём,\nВозможно ли иное сознание, кроме человеческого?\nвозможно, больше, ну, если не всех, то очень многих. А приближаемся ли мы\nсейчас к признанию, что возможны различные сознания не только на нашей\nэлектрохимии, но реализованные совсем по-другому? И, возможно, сознания, но какие-то другие, интеллект, но какой-то\nдругой? Можно как-то на эту тему внести хоть какую-то ясность в эту быстро развивающуюся и сейчас очень живую тему?\nНу, во-первых, я не очень много изучал сознания. Я начал заниматься этим лет 15\nназад. Серьёзно? А, хотя я тут нашёл передачу с Сергеем\nПетровичем Копицей, ээ, в конце девяностых годов, где я говорил, что\nсознание была посвящена сознанию, я уговорил его, э, сделать\nпередачу про сознание, потому что это было про вхождение науки в XXI век. И я\nубеждал, что сознание будет основной проблемой науки о мозге. э-э в XXI веке.\nНо я специалист больше всего по обучению и памяти. Если меня что-то роднит\nс ээ искусственными нейронными сетями, то это мои знания не в области сознания,\nа в области механизмов обучения памяти. Ну, в отношении разных сознаний. Ну,\nобучение и это то, что мы научились очень специальным образом делать для нейронных сетей и вдруг обнаружили, что\nони, не знаю, там, если угодно проходят тест тюринга, там, худо бедно, и в общем, прямо похожи на нас. Это\nудивительно. Это удивительно. Угу. Это удивительно. Отвечая на ваш вопрос\nпро возможность разных сознаний. Первая вещь, которая в науке о сознании сейчас\nпроисходит, очень крупная, она так и называется: проблема других\nсознания. Other minds. The problem of other minds. Она касается\nвопроса о сознании у других живых существ. Иначе говоря, единственные ли\nмы в этой вселенной или хотя бы на нашей земле\nобладатели этого свойства сознания? И становится ясно, что многие животные\nпо современному пониманию сознания, отличающемуся от\nпонимания сознания в XX веке, в середине XX века, когда сознанием считалось\nпреимущественно то, что свойственно лишь человеку с\nразвитым языком в культурной среде. Сейчас речь идёт, и это важно для\nискусственного интеллекта",

    "text": " будет. Сейчас речь идёт о том, что есть высокоразвитое сознание,\nСознание у животных\nа, а есть базовое сознание. Угу. А, и есть, поэтому назовём их два вида\nсуществ. Вот мы с вами когнитивные существа типа два. Мы высокопорядковые\nкогнитивные существа, но мы также когнитивные существа типа один, которые\nобладают такими же, видимо, признаками сознания, как другие К1\nсущества на нашей планеты. Кошечки, собачки, птицы\nи консенсус, что птицы обладают сознанием.\nА дальше начинается туман, где сейчас проходят очень активные исследования.\nРыбы земноводные, пресмыкающиеся,\nнасекомые, малюски, осьминогие, шмели.\nА они как? Мы в каком-то смысле понижаем планку всё время или мы открываем нечто новое,\nболее глубокое, в том числе в самих себе, и видим аналоги этого там. Совершенно верно.\nМы не понижаем планку, мы её сразу определили. И есть определение сознания как\nспособности чувствовать что-то, э, базовое, ощущать, каково это быть.\nА это не новое определение. Декарт, когда говорил: \"Я мыслю следовательно, я\nсуществую\". когета Эргосум. Он писал, что под когета, под когитары я\nимею в виду не только рациональное мышление, но и желание, чувства,\nнамерения и так далее, и так далее. Вот вопрос ээ в следующим. Если\nк этому относятся эти чувства, субъективные чувства тоски,\nжеланий, м восприятия событий в окружающем мире через какие-то\nкачества, боли, ээ, и это всё наш субъективный опыт, то\nвот эта фундаментальная, э, ступень, кто ею обладает?\nЧувствуют ли рыбы боль, когда они попадают на крючок или когда там тунца на рыболовецких\nсуднах там разрубают на куски живого? Чувствуют ли раки или омары ээ боль,\nкогда их бросают в кипящую воду? Это сложные вопросы. Юис Крол задал его об устрицах уже, да,\nпочти его. Да, точно, точно. Они настолько сложные, что\nу нас вроде бы нет способа это выяснить, потому что нет возможности у них спросить. Есть другие способы. Сознание ээ можно\nпонять по-настоящему, я в этом убеждён, только изнутри изнутри системы, которая\nобщается с окружающим миром. Не обязательно спрашивать, вы можете\nподсмотреть за признаками того, что происходит внутри. Есть там процессы, которые\nнаучная теория говорит, и есть сознательные процессы, и вы можете это распространять\nсоответственно на другие объекты. Как быть, например, с новорожденным младенцем? Вы же не можете его спросить.\nСознание младенца\nЭ на этом основании, что вы скажете? Что\nон не обладает сознанием или что это Тероинкогнито? с младенцем просто,\nпотому что он обладает таким же устройством, как мы, во взрослом состоянии. Мы экстраполяции. Так же, как\nя могу сказать, что, наверное, вы обладаете сознанием, я могу предположить это в отношении младенца. Но это не так\nпросто. Например, эээ ещё до начала восьмидесятых годов в ряде, эээ случаев\nв Соединённых Штатах операции на новорожденных младенцах проводились без\nнаркоза. Какой ужас! Потому что предполагалось, что они не ощущают боли.\nА и здесь возникает вопрос: а когда возникает сознание доязыковое у\nмладенца? В момент рождения, а если недоношенны",

Дальше мы\nидём даже по ступенькам развития гомо сапиенс. У нас возникают вопросы. Мы отклоняемся в сторону к животным. И, ээ,\nна основании того, что моей собаки мозг очень похож на мой, я могу также\nпредположить, что у неё есть сознание. Ээ, кроме того, по каким-то поведенческим признакам, что не очень\nнадёжно. А как быть с осминогом, у которого абсолютно другая нервная система, и у него восемь, по сути дела,\nмозгов в каждой щупальце, когда она может учиться и автономно делать разные\nразные вещи. И есть центральная довольно сложная нервная система. У неё там сотни\nмиллионов клеток. Смотрите, ну и тогда я я ваш я слышу вас, как вы как раз говорите, что вот\nИИ обладает сознанием?\nэти вещи, это сознание или что-то очень на него похожее развились эволюционно,\nпотому что нужно было воспринимать что-то в среде, отклики и так далее. Тогда искусственный интеллект - это\nвообще не сознание, потому что он не возник эволюционно в среде. Ему не нужно отклики, ему не нужно выживать, у него\nнет переживания по поводу среды. Это нечто совершенно другое. И вдруг оказывается, о чуда, что мы с ним\nразговариваем и не понимаем, что разговариваем с машиной. Это другая вещь. Ээ то, что мы с ним\nразговариваем и не понимаем, что разговариваемы с машиной, не должно\nвести к э заключением, что там внутри кто-то есть.\nВсё-таки для того, чтобы понять, есть кто-то внутри или нет, мы должны иметь\nтеорию механизмов внутреннего устройства сознания, заглянув в машину, несмотря на\nто, что в ней нет биологических клеток, нет\nжидкостей и химических веществ, нет генома в этих клеток, нет каких-то химических\nмедиаторов, сигналов между ними, Но операционально она некоторые вещи делает и имеет некоторую архитектуру.

А с другой стороны, сейчас вы говорите о осознании как о какой-то вещи, которая вырастает\nудивительным образом, независимо от носителя. Вот он наш электрохимический носитель, вот уж как сложился. у\nсобачек, в общем, похожий. Ну, прямо скажем, у осьминогов другой, но всё-таки\nне настолько отличающийся, как у вот этих вот, э, больших языковых моделей, где матрицы перемножают.

У них было имя Дарвин, Дарвин 1, Дарвин 2, Дарвин 3, Дар,\nпотому что они моделировали в этой искусственной нейронной сети как робот.\nУже сразу они были воплощены, у него было тело, э, выпущенный в какое-то\nпространство решает задачи по распознаванию объектов, щупая их или нахождению чего-то в пространстве. И в\n2005-2006 году появилась статья, которая привлекла\nмоё внимание очень сильно.

He is the number one highest\nrated user on MathOverflow, which I think is a legendary accomplishment. MathOverflow, by the way, is like StackOverflow\nbut for research mathematicians. He is also the author of several books, including Proof\nin the Art of Mathematics and Lectures on the Philosophy of Mathematics. And he has a great blog,\ninfinitelymore.xyz. This is a super technical and\nsuper fun conversation about the foundation of modern mathematics and some mind-bending ideas about infinity,\nnature of reality, truth, and the mathematical paradoxes that challenged some of the greatest minds of the 20th century.\nI have been hiding from the world a bit, reading, thinking, writing, soul-searching,\nas we all do every once in a while. But mostly, just deeply focused on work and preparing mentally for some challenging travel I\nplan to take on in the new year. Through all of it, a recurring thought comes to me,\nhow damn lucky I am to be alive and to get to experience so much love from folks across the\nworld. I want to take this moment to say thank you\nfrom the bottom of my heart for everything, for your support, for the many amazing conversations I've had\nwith people across the world. I got a little bit of hate\nand a whole lot of love, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm grateful for all of it.\nThis is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description, where you can also\nfind ways to contact me, ask questions, give feedback, and so on. And now, dear\nfriends, here's Joel David Hamkins. Some infinities are bigger than others. This idea from\nInfinity & paradoxes\nCantor at the end of the 19th century, I think it's fair to say, broke mathematics before rebuilding it. And\nI also read that this was a devastating and transformative discovery for several reasons. So one, it created a theological\ncrisis. Because infinity is associated with God, how could there be multiple infinities? And also, Cantor was deeply religious\nhimself. Second, there's a kind of mathematical civil war. The leading German mathematician Kronecker called Cantor a corrupter of youth\nand tried to block his career. Third, many fascinating paradoxes emerged from this, like Russell's\nparadox, about the set of all sets that don't contain themselves, and those threatened to make all of mathematics\ninconsistent. And finally, on the psychological side and the personal side, Cantor's own breakdown. He literally went mad,\nspending his final years in and out of sanatoriums, obsessed with proving the continuum hypothesis. So, laying that all out on the\ntable, can you explain the idea of infinity, that some infinities are\nlarger than others, and why was this so transformative to mathematics? - Well, that's a really great question. I would want to start\ntalking about infinit",

    "text": "y and telling the story much earlier than Cantor, actually, because, I mean, you can go all the way\nback to Ancient Greek times when Aristotle emphasized the potential aspect of infinity as opposed\nto the impossibility, according to him, of achieving an actual infinity. And Archimedes' method of exhaustion where\nhe is trying to understand the area of a region by carving it into more and more triangles, say, and\nsort of exhausting the area and thereby understanding the total area in terms of the sum of the areas of the pieces that he put into it.\nAnd it proceeded on this kind of potential understanding of infinity for hundreds of years, thousands of years. Almost all mathematicians were\nalmost all mathematicians were potentialists only and thought that it was incoherent to speak of an actual\ninfinity at all. Galileo is an extremely prominent exception to this, though he\nargued against this sort of potentialist orthodoxy in The Dialogue of Two New Sciences. Really lovely\naccount there that he gave. And that the... In many ways, Galileo was anticipating\nCantor's developments, except he couldn't quite push it all the way through and ended up throwing up his hands in confusion\nin a sense. I mean, the Galileo paradox is the idea or the observation that if you think about the natural numbers,\nI would start with zero but I think maybe he would start with one. The numbers one, two, three, four, and so on, and you think about which of those\nnumbers are perfect squares. So zero squared is zero and one squared is one and two squared is four, three\nsquared is nine, 16, 25, and so on. And Galileo observed that, that the perfect squares can be\nput into a one-to-one correspondence with all of the numbers. I mean, we just did it. I associated every number\nwith its square. And so it seems like on the basis of this one-to-one correspondence that\nthere should be exactly the same number of squares, perfect squares as there are numbers, and\nyet there's all the gaps in between the perfect squares, right? And, and this suggests that there should be fewer perfect squares, more\nnumbers than squares because the numbers include all the squares plus a lot more in between them, right? And Galileo was quite troubled by this observation because\nhe took it to cause a kind of incoherence in the comparison of infinite quantities, right? And another example\nis, if you take two line segments of different lengths, and you can imagine drawing a kind of foliation,\na fan of lines that connect them. So the endpoints are matched from the shorter to the longer segment, and the midpoints are matched and\nso on. So spreading out the lines as you go. And so every point on the shorter line would be associated with\na, a unique distinct point on the longer line in a one-to-one way. And so it seems like the two\nline segments have the same number of points on them because of that, even though the longer one is longer. And so it\nmakes, again, a kind of confusion over our ideas about infinity. And al",

    "text": "so with two circles, if you just place them\nconcentrically and draw the rays from the center, then every point on the smaller circle is associated\nwith a corresponding point on the larger circle, you know, in a one-to-one way. And, and again, that seems to show that the\nsmaller circle has the same number of points on it as the larger one, precisely precisely because they can be put into this one-to-one correspondence.\nOf course, the contemporary attitude about this situation is that those two infinities are exactly the same, and that Galileo was right in those\nobservations about the equinumerosity. We would talk about it now by appealing to what I call the Cantor-Hume principle, or some people\njust call it Hume's principle, which is the idea that if you have two collections, whether they're finite or infinite, then we want to\nsay that those two collections have the same size. They're equinumerous if and only if there's a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between those collections. Galileo was observing that line segments of different lengths are equinumerous,\nand the perfect squares are equinumerous with all of the natural numbers, and any two circles are equinumerous, and so\non. The tension between the Cantor-Hume principle and what could be called Euclid's principle, which is that the\nwhole is always greater than the part, is a principle that Euclid appealed to in the Elements many times when he's calculating\narea and so on. It's a basic idea that if something is just a part of another thing, then the\nwhole is greater than the part. So what Galileo was troubled by was this tension between\nwhat we call the Cantor-Hume principle and Euclid's principle. It wasn't fully resolved, I\nthink, until Cantor. He's the one who really explained so clearly about these different sizes of infinity and so on\nin a way that was so compelling. He exhibited two different infinite sets and proved that\nthey're not equinumerous; they can't be put into one-to-one correspondence. It's traditional to talk about the\nuncountability of the real numbers. Cantor's big result was that the set of all real numbers is an uncountable set. Maybe if we're\ngoing to talk about countable sets, then I would suggest that we talk about Hilbert's Hotel, which really makes that idea perfectly clear.\n- Yeah, let's talk about Hilbert's Hotel. - Hilbert's Hotel is a hotel with infinitely many rooms. Each\nroom is a full floor suite. So there's floor zero... I always start with zero because for me, the natural numbers start with zero, although that's\nmaybe a point of contention for some mathematicians. The other mathematicians are wrong. - Like I mentioned, I'm a programmer, so starting at zero is a wonderful place to start.\n- Exactly. So there's floor zero, floor one, floor two, or room zero, one, two, three, and so on, just like the natural numbers. So Hilbert's Hotel has a\nroom for every natural number, and it's completely full. There's a person occupying room N for\nevery N. But meanwhile, a new gues",

And everyone\nmoved at the same time. And of course, we never want to be placing two different guests in the same room, and we want everyone to have their own private room\nand... But when you move everyone up one room, then the bottom room, room zero, becomes available, of course. And so he can put the new guest in\nthat room. So even when you have infinitely many things, then the new guest can be accommodated. And that's a way of\nshowing how the particular infinity of the occupants of Hilbert's Hotel, it violates Euclid's principle. I\nmean, it exactly illustrates this idea because adding one more element to a set didn't make it larger, because we\ncan still have a one-to-one correspondence between the total new guests and the old guests by the room number, right?\n- So, to just say one more time, the hotel is full. - The hotel is full.\n- And then you could still squeeze in one more, and that breaks the traditional notion of mathematics and breaks\npeople's brains when they try to think about infinity, I suppose. This is a property of infinity.\n- It's a property of infinity that sometimes when you add an element to a set, it doesn't get larger. That's what this\nexample shows. But one can go on with Hilbert's Hotel, for example. I mean, maybe the next day, you know,\n20 people show up all at once. We can easily do the same trick again, just move everybody up 20 rooms. And then we would have 20\nempty rooms at the bottom, and those new 20 guests could go in. But on the following weekend, a giant bus pulled up, Hilbert's\nbus. And Hilbert's bus has, of course, infinitely many seats. There's Seat Zero, Seat One, Seat Two, Seat Three, and so\non. And so one wants to... You know, all the people on the bus want to check into the hotel, but the hotel is completely full. So what is the manager going to\ndo? And when I talk about Hilbert's Hotel, when I teach Hilbert's Hotel in class, I always demand that the\nstudents provide, you know, the explanation of- of how to do it. So maybe I'll ask you.\nCan you tell me, yeah, what is your idea about how to fit them all in the hotel, everyone on the bus, and also the current occupants?\n- You separate the hotel into even and odd rooms, and you squeeze in the new\nHilbert bus people into the odd rooms and the previous occupants go into the even rooms. - That's exactly right. That's a very easy way to do it. If you\njust tell all the current guests to double their room number, so in Room N, you move to Roo",

And so all the odd rooms become empty that way. And now we can\nput the bus occupants into the odd-numbered rooms. - And by doing so, you have now shoved an infinity into another infinity.\n- That's right. So what it really shows... I mean, another way of thinking about it is that, well, we can define that a set is\ncountable if it is equinumerous with a set of natural numbers. And a kind of easy way to understand what that's\nsaying in terms of Hilbert's Hotel is that a set is countable if it fits into Hilbert's Hotel, 'cause Hilbert's Hotel\nbasically is the set of natural numbers in terms of the room numbers. So to be equinumerous with a set of natural numbers is just the same thing as to fit into Hilbert's\nHotel. And so what we've shown is that if you have two countably infinite sets, then their\nunion is also countably infinite. If you put them together and form a new set with all of the elements of either of them, then that union set is still\nonly countably infinite. It didn't get bigger. And that's a remarkable property for a notion\nof infinity to have, I suppose. But if you thought that there was only one kind of infinity, then it wouldn't be surprising at all, because if you take\ntwo infinite sets and put them together, then it's still infinite. And so if there were only one kind of infinity, then it shouldn't be surprising...\nthat the union of two countable sets is countable. So there's another way to push this a bit harder, and that is when Hilbert's train\narrives, and Hilbert's train has infinitely many train cars...\n...and each train car has infinitely many seats. And so we have an infinity of infinities of the train\npassengers together with the current occupants of the hotel, and everybody on the train wants to check in to Hilbert's Hotel.\nSo the manager can, again, of course, send a message up to all the rooms telling every person to double\ntheir room number again. And so that will occupy all the even-numbered rooms again, and but free up again the\nodd-numbered rooms. So somehow, we want to put the train passengers into the odd-numbered rooms. And so while\nevery train passenger is on some car, let's say Car C and Seat S,\nso somehow, we have to take these two coordinates, you know, C, S, the car number and the seat number, and produce from\nit an odd number in a one-to-one way, you know? And that's actually not very difficult. In\nfact, one can just use, say... An easy way to do it is to just use the number\n3 to the C times 5 to the S. 3 to the C, 3 to the car number, so 3 x 3 x\n3, you know, the number of the car. You multiply 3 by itself, the number of the train car, and then you multiply 5 by itself\nthe seat number of times, and then you multiply those two numbers together. So 3 to the C times 5 to the S. That's\nalways an odd number, 'cause the prime factorization has only 3s and 5s",

    "text": " in it. There's no 2 there. So therefore, it's\ndefinitely an odd number, and it's always different because of the uniqueness of prime factorization. So every number\ncan be factored uniquely into primes. So if you have a number of that form, then you can just factor it, and that tells you the exponent on 3 and the\nexponent on 5. And so you know exactly which person it was, which car they came from, and which seat they came from.\n- And prime factorization is every single number can be\ndecomposed into the atoms of mathematics, which is the prime numbers. You can multiply them together to achieve that number.\nAnd that's prime factorization. You're showing 3 and 5 are both prime numbers,\nodd. So through this magical formula, you can deal with this\ntrain, infinite number of cars, with each car having infinite number of seats.\n- Exactly right. We've proved that if you have countably many countable sets, then the union of those\nsets, putting all those sets together into one giant set, is still countable. You know, because the train cars are each countable, plus the current\nhotel. It's sort of like another train car, if you want to think about it that way. The current occupants of the hotel could, you know, have the same number as\nany of the train cars. So putting countably many countable sets together to make one big union set is\nstill countable. It's quite remarkable, I think. I mean when I first learned this many, many years ago, I was completely shocked by it and\ntransfixed by it. It was quite amazing to me that this notion of countable infinity could be closed under this process of\ninfinitely many infinities adding up still to the very same infinity, which is a strong instance, a\nstrong violation of Euclid's principle once again, right? So, the new set that we built is... has many more elements than the old\nset in the sense that there are additional elements, but it doesn't have many more elements in terms of its size because it's still just a countable\ninfinity and it fits into Hilbert's Hotel. - Have you been able to sort of internalize a good intuition about\ncountable infinity? Because that is a pretty weird thing. You can have a countably\ninfinite set of countably infinite sets, and you can shove it all in and it still is a countable infinite set.\n- Yeah, that's exactly right. I mean, I guess, of course, when you work with these notions, the argument of\nof Hilbert's Hotel becomes kind of clear. There are many other ways to talk about it too. For example, let's think about, say,\nthe integer lattice, the grid of points that you get by taking pairs of natural numbers, say, so the upper\nright quadrant of the integer lattice, yeah? So there's the, you know, row zero, row one, row two and so on, column zero, column one, column two and so on,\nand each row and column has a countable infinity of points on it, right?\nSo those dots, if you think about them as dots, are really the same as the train cars if you think about each column\nof... in that integer la",

    "text": "ttice, it's a countable infinity. It's like one train car and then there's the next train car next to it, and then the next column\nnext to that, the next train car. And so, but if we think about it in this grid manner, then I can imagine\na kind of winding path winding through these grid points, like up and down the diagonals.\nWinding back and forth. So I start at the corner point and then I go down, up and to the left, and then down and to the right, up and to the left, down and to the right, and so on,\nin such a way that I'm going to hit every grid point on this path.\nSo, this gives me a way of assigning room numbers to the points. Because every grid point is going to be the\nNth point on that path for some N. And that that gives a correspondence between the grid points and the natural numbers\nthemselves. So it's a kind of different picture. Before, we used this 3 to the C, 5 times 5 to the S, which is a kind of, you\nknow, overly arithmetic way to think about it. But there's a kind of direct way to understand that it's still a\ncountable infinity when you have countably many countable sets, because you can just start putting them on this list. And as long as you give each of the infinite collections a\nchance to add one more person to the list, then you're going to accommodate everyone in any of the sets in one list.\n- Yeah, it's a really nice visual way to think about it. You just zigzag your way across the grid to make sure everybody's included. That gives you an algorithm for including\neverybody. So, can you speak to the uncountable infinities? - Yeah, absolutely. - What are the integers and the real numbers-\n- Correct - and what is the line that Cantor was able to find? - Maybe there's one more step I want to insert before doing that.\nWhich is the rational numbers. So we did pairs of natural numbers.\nRight? That's the train car, basically. But maybe it's a little bit informative to think about the rational, the fractions, the set of\nfractions, or rational numbers, because a lot of people maybe have an expectation that maybe this is a bigger\ninfinity because the rational numbers are densely ordered. Between any two fractions, you can find another fraction, right?\nThe average of two fractions is another fraction. And so, sometimes people,\nit seems to be a different character than the integers, which are discretely ordered, right? From any integer, there's a next one and a\nprevious one, and so on. But that's not true in the rational numbers. And yet, the rational numbers are\nalso still only a countable infinity. And the way to see that is actually\nit's just exactly the same as Hilbert's train again, because every fraction consists of two integers: the numerator and the\ndenominator. And so if I tell you two natural numbers, then you know what fraction I'm talking about. I mean, plus the\nsign issue, I mean if it's positive or negative. But if you just think about the positive fractions, then, you know, you have the numbers of the form\nP over Q, wher",

And you might think, \"Well, every set\nis going to be countable because there's only one infinity.\" I mean, if that's a kind of perspective maybe that you're adopting, but it's not\ntrue, and that's the profound achievement that Cantor made is proving that the set of real numbers is not a countable infinity. It's a strictly larger\ninfinity, and therefore there's more than one concept of infinity, more than one size of infinity.\n- So let's talk about the real numbers. What are the real numbers? Why do they break infinity? The countable infinity. Looking it up on Perplexity, real numbers\ninclude all the numbers that can be represented on the number line, encompassing both rational and irrational numbers. We've spoken about the rational numbers, and the\nrational numbers, by the way, are by definition, the numbers that can be represented as a fraction of two integers.\n- That's right. So with the real numbers, we have the algebraic numbers. We have, of course, all the rational numbers. The integers and the rationals are all part of the\nreal number system. But then also, we have the algebraic numbers like the square root of 2 or the cube root of 5 and so on. Numbers that solve an\nalgebraic equation over the integers, those are known as algebraic numbers. It was an open question for a long time whether that was\nall of the real numbers or whether there would exist numbers that are the transcendental numbers. The\ntranscendental numbers are real numbers that are not algebraic. - And we won't even go to the surreal numbers about which you have a wonderful blog post.\nWe'll talk about that a little bit later. - Oh, great. So it was Liouville who first proved that\nthere are transcendental numbers, and he exhibited a very specific number that's now known as the Liouville constant, which is a transcendental\nnumber. Cantor also famously proved that there are many, many transcendental numbers. In fact, it follows from his\nargument on the uncountability of the real numbers that there are uncountably many transcendental numbers. So most real numbers are transcendental.\n- And again, going to Perplexity, \"Transcendental numbers are 'real' or 'complex' numbers; they are not the root of any nonzero polynomial with\ninteger or rational coefficients. This means they cannot be expressed as solutions to algebraic equations with integer coefficients,\nsetting them apart from algebraic numbers.\" - So some of the famous transcendental numbers would include the number pi,\nyou know, the 3.14159265 and so on.\nSo that's a transcendental number. Also, Euler's constant, the e, like e to the x, the exponential function.\n- So you could say that some of the sexiest numbers in mathematics are all transcendental numbers? - Absolutely. That's true. Yeah, yeah. Although, you know, I don't know, square root of two is\npretty - Square root. All right.",

Well, you basically said, \"I love all numbers.\" - Yeah, basically.\n- Is that what you said? - Yeah. That was my intention. - Back to Cantor's argument. Let's go. - Okay, so Cantor wants to prove that\nthe infinity of the real numbers is different and strictly larger than the infinity of the natural numbers. So the natural\nnumbers are the numbers that start with zero and add one successively, so zero, one, two, three, and so on. And the real numbers, as\nwe said, are the numbers that come from the number line, including all the integers and the rationals and the algebraic numbers and\nthe transcendental numbers and all of those numbers altogether. Now, obviously, since the natural numbers are included in the real numbers,\nwe know that the real numbers are at least as large as the natural numbers. And so the claim that we want to prove is that\nit's strictly larger. So suppose that it wasn't strictly larger. So\nthen they would have the same size. But to have the same size, remember, means by definition that there's a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between them. So we suppose that the re",

R sub N is the Nth real number on the\nlist. Basically, our assumption allows us to think of the real numbers as having been placed on a list, R1, R2, and so on.\nOkay, and now I'm going to define the number Z, and it's going to be... The integer part is going to be a zero, and then I'm going to\nput a decimal place, and then I'm going to start specifying the digits of this number Z. D1, D2, D3, and so on. And what\nI'm going to make sure is that the Nth digit after the decimal point of Z is different from the Nth digit of the Nth number on the list.\nOkay? So, to specify the Nth digit of Z, I go to the Nth number on the list, R sub N, and I look at its Nth\ndigit after the decimal point. And whatever that digit is, I make sure that my digit is different from it. Okay?\nAnd then I want to do something a little bit more, and that is I'm going to make it different in a way that I'm never using the\ndigits zero or nine. I'm just always using the other digits and not zero and it would form a kind of diagonal going down and to the right, and that,\nfor that reason, this argument is called the diagonal argument because we're looking at the Nth digit of the Nth number, and those exist on a kind of diagonal going\ndown. And we've made our number Z so that the Nth digit of Z is different from the Nth digit of the Nth number.\nBut now it follows that Z is not on the list because\nZ is different from R1 because, well, the first digit after the decimal point of Z is different from the first\ndigit of R1 after the decimal point. That's exactly how we built it. And the second digit of Z is different from the second digit\nof R2 and so on. The Nth digit of Z is different from the Nth digit of R sub N for every N.

And so that's the main contradiction. - And so it's a kind of proof by construction.\n- Exactly. So given a list of numbers, Cantor's proving... It's interesting that you say that actually, because there's a kind of philosophical\ncontroversy that occurs in connection with this observation about whether Cantor's construction is constructive or not.\nGiven a list of numbers, Cantor gives us a specific means of constructing a real number that's not on the list, is a\nway of thinking about it. There's this one aspect, which I alluded to earlier, but\nsome real numbers have more than one decimal representation, and it causes this slight problem\nin the argument. For example, the number one, you can write it as 1.0000\nforever, but you can also write it as 0.999 forever. Those are two\ndifferent decimal representations of exactly the same number. - You beautifully got rid of the zeros and the nines",

    "text": ". Therefore, we don't need to even consider that,\nand the proof still works. - Exactly, because the only kind of case where that phenomenon occurs is\nwhen the number is eventually zero or eventually nine. And so since our number Z never had any zeros or nines in it, it wasn't one of those\nnumbers. And so actually, in those cases, we didn't need to do anything special to diagonalize. Just the mere fact that our number has a unique representation\nalready means that it's not equal to those numbers. So maybe it was controversial in Cantor's day more than 100 years ago, but I think it's\nmost commonly looked at today as, you know, one of the initial main results in set theory, and it's\nprofound and amazing and insightful and the beginning point of so many later arguments. And this diagonalization\nidea has proved to be an extremely fruitful proof method, and almost every major result in mathematical logic\nis using in an abstract way the idea of diagonalization. It was really the start of so\nmany other observations that were made, including Russell's paradox and the halting problem and the recursion\ntheorem, and so many other principles are using diagonalization at their core. So...\n- Can we just step back a little bit? - Sure. - This infinity crisis led to a kind of rebuilding of mathematics. So it'd be\nnice if you lay out the things it resulted in. So one is set theory became the foundation of mathematics. All mathematics could now\nbe built from sets, giving math its first truly rigorous foundation. The axiomatization\nof mathematics, the paradoxes forced mathematicians to develop ZFC and other axiomatic systems, and mathematical logic emerged. Gödel, Turing, and\nothers created entire new fields. So can you explain what set theory is and,\nhow does it serve as a foundation of modern mathematics and maybe even the foundation of truth?\n- That's a great question. Set theory really has two roles that it's serving. There's kind\nof two ways that set theory emerges. On the one hand, set theory\nis its own subject of mathematics, with its own problems and questions and answers and proof\nmethods. And so really, from this point of view, set theory is about the transfinite recursive constructions or well-founded definitions and\nconstructions. And those ideas have been enormously fruitful and set theorists have looked into them and\ndeveloped so many ideas coming out of that. But set theory has also happened to serve in this other\nfoundational role. It's very common to hear things said about set theory that really aren't taking account of this distinction between\nthe two roles that it's serving. It's its own subject, but it's also serving as a foundation of mathematics. So in its foundational role, set\ntheory provides a way to think of a collection of things as one thing. That's the central idea of set theory. A set is a\ncollection of things, but you think of the set itself as one abstract thing. So when you form the\nset of real numbers, then that is a set.

And so we have a lot of different axioms that describe the nature of this\nidea of thinking of a collection of things as one thing itself, one abstract thing. - And axioms are, I guess, facts that we assume are true, based on which we then\nbuild the ideas of mathematics. So there's a bunch of facts, axioms about sets\nthat we can put together, and if they're sufficiently...... powerful, we can then build on top of that a lot of really interesting mathematics.\n- Yeah, I think that's right. So, I mean, the history of the current set theory axioms, known as the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, came out in the\nearly 20th century with Zermelo's idea. I mean, the history is quite fascinating because Zermelo in 1904 offered a proof\nthat what's called the axiom of choice implies the well-order principle. So he described his proof, and that was\nextremely controversial at the time. And there was no theory, there weren't any axioms there. Cantor was not working in an axiomatic\nframework. He didn't have a list of axioms in the way that we have for set theory now, and Zermelo didn't either. And his\nideas were challenged so much with regard to the well-order theorem—\n—that he was pressed to produce the theory in which his argument could be formalized, and that was the origin of\nwhat's known as Zermelo set theory. - And going to perplexity, the axiom of choice is a fundamental principle in set\ntheory which states that for any collection of non-empty sets, it is possible to select exactly one element from each set, even\nif no explicit rule to make the choices given. This axiom allows the construction of a new set containing one element from each\noriginal set, even in cases where the collection is infinite or where there is no natural way to specify a selection\nrule. So this was controversial and this was described before there's even a language for axiomatic systems.\n- That's right. So on the one hand, I mean, the axiom of choice principle is\ncompletely obvious that we want this to be true, that it is true. I mean, a lot of people take it as a law of logic. If you have\na bunch of sets, then there's a way of picking an element from each of them. picking an element from each of them. There's a\nfunction. If I have a bunch of sets, then there's a function that, when you apply it to any one of those sets, gives you an element of that set.\nIt's- it's a completely natural principle. I mean, it's called the axiom of choice, which is a way of sort of anthropomorphizing the\nmathematical idea. It's not like the function is choosing something. I mean, it's just that if you were to make such choices,\nthere would be a function that consisted of the choices that you made. And the difficulty is that when you- when you can't specify a\nrule or a procedure by which you're making choices, then it's difficult to say choices, then it's difficult to say what the fun",

Yeah, this is the way of thinking about the axiom of choice.\n- So we're going to say the- the- the three letters of ZFC may be a lot on this conversation. You already mentioned-\n- Right - ...Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, that's the Z and the F and the C in that is this... and the C in that is this...

So one should be aware also that there's huge parts of mathematics that don't... That pay attention to whether the axiom of\nchoice is being used and they don't want to use the axiom of choice, so they work out the consequences that's- that are possible without the axiom of choice or with weakened\nforms of- of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and so on. And that's quite a- there's quite a vibrant amount of work in that area. I mean, but going back to the\naxiom of choice for a bit, it's maybe interesting to- to give Russell's description\nof how to think about the axiom of choice. So Russell describes, this rich person who has a- an infinite closet. And in that closet, he has\ninfinitely many pairs of shoes and he tells his butler to\n\"Please go and give me one shoe from each pair.\" And- and the butler can do this easily because he can... For any pair of shoes, he\ncan just always pick the left shoe. I mean, there's a way of picking that we can describe. We always take the left one or\nalways take the right one, or take the left one if it's a red shoe and the right one if it's a brown shoe or, you know. We can invent rules that would\nresult in these kind of choice functions, so we can describe explicit choice functions. And for those cases, you don't need the axiom of choice\nyou don't need the Axiom of Choice to know that there's a choice function. When you can describe a specific way of choosing, then you don't need to\nappeal to the axiom to know that there's a choice But the problematic case occurs when you think about the infinite collection\nwhen you think about the infinite collection of socks that the person has in their closet. And if we assume that socks are\nsort of indistinguishable within each pair, you know, they match each other, indiscernible, then the- the butler wouldn't have any kind of rule for\nwhich sock in each pair to pick. And so it's not so clear that he has a way of-\nof producing one sock from each pair because... Right? So that's what's at stake, is the question of whether\nyou can specify a rule by which the choice function, you know, a rule that it obeys\nthat defines the choice function, or whether there's sort of this arbitrary choosing aspect to it.

If I have the\nidea that my mathematical ontology is rich with objects, then I think that, that there are all kinds of functions and\nways of choosing. Those are all part of the mathematical reality that I wanna be talking about.... and so I don't have any problem\nasserting the Axiom of Choice. Yes, there is a way of choosing, But I can't t- necessarily tell you what it is.\nBut in a mathematical argument, I can assume that I fix the choice function because I know that there is one. So it's a... The\nphilosophical difference between working when you have the Axiom of Choice and when you don't is the question of this constructive nature of the\nargument. So if you make an argument and you appeal to the Axiom of Choice, then maybe you're admitting that the objects that\nyou're producing in the proof are not gonna be constructive. You're not gonna be able to necessarily say specific things about them.\nBut if you're just claiming to make an existence claim, that's totally fine. Whereas if you have a constructive attitude about ma- the nature of mathematics, and you\nthink that mathematical claims maybe are only warranted when you can provide an explicit procedure for producing the mathematical objects that you're dealing\nwith then you're probably gonna wanna deny the axiom of choice and maybe much more.\n- Can we maybe speak to the axioms that underlie ZFC? So cone of perplexity, ZFC, or Zermelo-Fraenkel\nset theory with the Axiom of Choice, as we mentioned, is the standard foundation for most modern mathematics. It consists of the following main axioms: Axiom\nof Extensionality, Axiom of Empty Set, Axiom of Pairing, Axiom of Union, Axiom of Power Set, Axiom of Infinity, Axiom of\nSeparation, Axiom of Replacement, Axiom of Regularity, and Axiom of Choice. Some of these are quite basic, but it would be nice\nto kinda give people a sense- ...of what it means to be an axiom. Like, what kind of basic\nfacts we can lay on the table on which we can build some beautiful mathematics. - Yeah, so the history of it is really quite fascinating. So, Zermelo introduced\nmost of these axioms, I mean, as part of what's now called Zermelo set theory, to formalize his proof from the Axiom of\nChoice to the Well-Order Principle, which was an extremely controversial result. So in 1904, he gave the proof without the theory, and then he was challenged to\nprovide the theory. And so in 1908, he produced the Zermelo set theory and gave the proof that\nin that theory, you can prove that every set admits a well ordering.

So it's maybe the most primitive axiom in some respect.\n- Well, there's also, just to give a flavor, there exists a set with no elements, called the empty set. For any two sets, there's a\nset that contains exactly those two sets as elements. For any set, there's a set that contains exactly the elements of the\nelements of that set, so the union set.

In the axiom of infinity, there exists an infinite set, typically a set\nthat contains the empty set and is closed under the operation of adding one more element. Back to our hotel example.\n- That's right. - And there's more, but this is kind of fascinating. Just put yourself in the mindset of people at\nthe beginning of this, of trying to formalize set theory. It's fascinating that humans can do that.\n- I read some historical accounts by historians about that time period, specifically about Zermelo's axioms and his\nproof of the well-order theorem. And the historians were saying never before in the\nhistory of mathematics has a mathematical theorem been argued about so publicly and so vociferously as that theorem of\nZermelo's. And it's fascinating also because the axiom of choice was\nwidely regarded as a kind of, you know, basic principle at first, but then when, but people were very suspicious of the well-order theorem because no one could\nimagine a well ordering, say, of the real numbers. And so this was a case when Zermelo seemed to be, from principles\nthat seemed quite reasonable, proving this obvious untruth. And so people were, mathematicians were objecting. But then\nZermelo and others actually looked into the mathematical papers and so on of some of the people who had been\nobjecting so vociferously, and found, in many cases, that they were implicitly using the axiom of choice in their\nown arguments, even though they would argue publicly against it.

People like to pay attention to when the axiom of choice is used or not used in\nmathematical arguments, up until this day. It used to be more important. In the early 20th century it was very important because people didn't know if it\nwas a consistent theory or not, and there were these antinomies arising. and so there was a worry about consistency of the axioms.\nbut then, of course, eventually, with the result of, of Godel and Cohen and so on, they... this consistency question specifical",

And so in that... from that point of view, the need to pay attention to whether you're using it or not from a consistency point of view is somehow less\nimportant. But still there's this reason to pay attention to it on the grounds of these constructivist\nideas that I had mentioned earlier. - And we should say, in set theory, consistency means that it is impossible to\nderive a contradiction from the axioms of the theory. It means that there are no contradictions. That's a...\n- That's right - A consistent axiomatic system is that there are no contradictions. - A consistent theory is one for which you cannot prove a contradiction from that\ntheory. - Maybe a quick pause, a quick break, a quick bathroom break.\nRussell's paradox\nYou mentioned to me offline we were talking about Russell's paradox and that there's a- a nice, another kind of anthropomorphizable proof of\nuncountability. I was wondering if you can lay that out. - Oh yeah, sure. Absolutely. - Both Russell's paradox and the proof.\n- Right. So we talked about Cantor's proof\nthat the real numbers, the set of real numbers is an uncountable infinity, it's a strictly larger infinity than the natural numbers. But Cantor\nactually proved a- a much more general fact, namely that for any set whatsoever, the power\nset of that set is a strictly larger set. So the power set is the set containing all the subsets of the original set. So if you have a set\nand you look at the collection of all of its subsets, then Cantor proved that this is- this is a bigger set. They're not\nequinumerous. Of course, there's always at least as many subsets as elements because for any element you can make, the- the singleton subset\nthat has only that guy as a member, right? So there's always at least as many subsets as elements. But the question is\nwhether they, whether it's strictly more or not. And so Cantor reasoned like this. It's very simple. It's a kind of\ndistilling the abstract diagonalization idea without being encumbered by the complexity of the real numbers. So, we have a set X,\nand we're looking at all of its subsets. That's the power set of X. Suppose that X and the power set of X have the same\nsize. Suppose, towards contradiction, they have the same size. So that means we can associate to every individual of X a subset.\nAnd so now let me define a new set. Another set, I'm going to define it. Let's call it D. And D is the subset\nof X that contains all the individuals that are not in their set. Every individual\nwas associated with a subset of X, and I'm looking at the individuals that are not in their set.\nMaybe nobody's like that. Maybe there's no element of X that's like that, or maybe they're all like ",

And so because of the equinumerosity, it would have to be attached to a particular individual,\nyou know? And- ...but that... let's call that person, it should\nbe a name starting with D, so Diana. And now we ask, is Diana an element of D or not?\nBut if Diana is an element of D, then she is in her set. So she shouldn't be because the\nset D was the set of individuals that are not in their set. So if Diana is in D, then she shouldn't be. But if she isn't in\nD, then she wouldn't be in her set. And so she should be in D. That's a contradiction. So therefore, the number\nof subsets is always greater than the number of elements for any set.\nAnd the anthropomorphizing idea is the following. I'd like to talk about it this way. For any collection\nof people, you can form more committees from them than there are people, even if you have infinetely many people.\nSuppose you have an infinite set of people. And what's a committee? Well, a committee is just a list of who's on the committee, basically.\nThe members of the committee. So there's all the two-person committees and there's all the one-person committees, and there's the universal,\nthe worst committee, the one that everyone is on. Okay. The best committee is the empty committee. With no members and never meets and so on. Or is the empty\ncommittee meeting all the time? I'm not sure. - Yeah. That's... wow, that's a profound question. And does a committee with just one member meet also as a-\n- Yeah, maybe it's always in session. I don't know. So the claim is that there are more committees than people.\nOkay. Suppose not. Well, then we could make an association between the people and the committees. So we would have every committee\ncould be named after a person in a one-to-one way. And I'm not saying that the person is on the committee that's named after them,\nor not on it, whatever. Maybe sometimes that happens, sometimes it doesn't. I don't know. It doesn't matter. But let's form what I call committee D, which consists of all the\npeople that are not on the committee that's named after them.\nOkay. Maybe that's everyone, maybe it's no one, maybe it's half the people. It doesn't matter. That's a committee. It's a set of people. And so it has to be named after\nsomeone. Let's call that person Daniella. So now we ask, is\nDaniella on the committee that's named after her? Well, if she is, then she shouldn't be because it was the\ncommittee of people who aren't on their own committee. And if she isn't, then she should be. So again, it's a\ncontradiction.

Every set of fruits\nmakes a salad, a fruit salad. Okay. And we want to prove that for any collection of fruits, even if there are infinitely\nmany different kinds of fruit, for any collection of fruits, there are more possible fruit salads than there are fruits.\nSo if not, then you can put a one-to-one correspondence between the fruits and the fruit salads, so you could name every fruit\nsalad after a fruit. That fruit might not be in that salad, it doesn't matter. We're just... it's a naming, a one-to-one correspondence.\nAnd then, of course, we form the diagonal salad, which consists\nof all the fruits that are not in the salad that's named after them.\nAnd that's a perfectly good salad. It might be the kind of diet salad, if it was the empty salad, or it might be the universal\nsalad which had all fruits in it, if all the fruits were in it. Or it might have just some and not all. So that diagonal salad would have to be named after\nsome fruit. So let's suppose it's named after durian, meaning that it was associated with durian in the one-to-one correspondence. And then\nwe ask, well, is durian in the salad that it's named after? And if it is, then it\nshouldn't be. And if it isn't, then it should be. And so it's again the same contradiction. So all of those arguments are just the same as\nCantor's proof that the power set of any set is bigger than the set. And this is exactly the same logic\nthat comes up in Russell's paradox, because Russell is arguing that the class of all sets can't be a set,\nbecause if it were, then we could form the the set of all sets that are not elements of themselves.\nSo basically, what Russell is proving is that there are more collections of sets than elements. Because we can form the\ndiagonal class, you know, the class of all sets that are not elements of themselves. If that were a set, then it would be an\nelement of itself if and only if it was not an element of itself. It's exactly the same logic in all four of those arguments. Yeah.\nSo there can't be a class of all sets, because if there were, then there would have to be a class of all sets that aren't elements of themselves. But that set\nwould be an element of itself if and only if it's not an element of itself, which is a contradiction. So this is the essence of the Russell paradox. I don't call it the\nRussell paradox. Actually, when I teach it, I call it Russell's theorem. There's no universal set. And it's not really\nconfusing anymore. At the time, it was very confusing, but now we've absorbed this\nnature of set theory into our fundamental understanding of how sets are, and it's not confusing anymore.

But to understand the theorems, you really have to start a little\nbit earlier with Hilbert's program. because at that time, you know, with the Russell Paradox and so on, there were these various contradictions\npopping up in various parts of set theory and the Burali-Forti paradox and so on. And, and Hilbert was famously supportive of set theory. I mean,\nthere's this quote of him saying, \"No one shall cast us from the paradise that Cantor has created for\nus.\" And what I take him to mean by that is he was so captured by the idea of using set theory as a foundation\nof mathematics and it was so powerful and convenient and unifying in a way that was extremely important. And he wasn't, he didn't wanna give that\nup, despite the danger of these paradoxes, these contradictions, basically, is how some people viewed them. And so,\n- this minefield of paradoxes. Yeah. - Right. A minefield. That's a really good way of describing the situation. And\nso Hilbert said, \"Well, look, we have to fix this problem, you know. We wanna use the set theory foundations, but we want to\ndo it in a way that is trustworthy and reliable. We can't allow that the foundations of mathematics are in\nquestion. You know, this is a kind of attitude, I think, that underlies Hilbert\nand the Hilbert program. And so he proposed, \"Look, we're going to have this strong theory, this set theory that we want to be proving\nour theorems in but I I mean, on the one hand, we want it to be as strong as possible. We would\nlike it to answer all the questions.\" There's another famous quote of Hilbert in his retirement address where,\nhe proclaims, \"Wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen.\" So, \"We must know, we will know,\" in\nwhich he's very optimistic about the ability of mathematics to answer all of the questions of mathematics that\nwe have posed. We have all these problems we want t",

We're going to solve all these problems.\" So we want to propose this strong theory\nand one has the sense that he had in mind set theory in which all the questions are going to be\nanswered. Okay? But secondly, we want to combine that with, in a very\nweak arithmetic, purely finitistic theory, we want to prove\nthat the reasoning process of the strong theory is safe. Okay? So in order to make sense of that point of view, you\nbasically have to invent the philosophy of formalism, where we can look at what is a\nproof, what is the nature of mathematical reasoning. And on Hilbert's way of thinking about\nthis, a proof is basically itself a finitistic kind of object. It's a sequence\nof... If you think about the nature of what a proof is, it's a sequence of assertions which can be viewed as sort of sequences of symbols\nthat conform with certain rules of logical reasoning. And this is a formalist way of understanding the nature of\nproof. So we think about a proof in a kind of syntactic, formal way. Even though the contents of those statements might be\nreferring to infinite uncountable objects, the statements themselves are not infinite uncountable objects. The statements themselves are\njust finite sequences of symbols. - So when you think of proof as, maybe it's fair to say, almost like a\noutside of math. It's like, tools operating on math. And then for Hilbert, he thought proof is inside the axiomatic system. Something like this.\n- Yeah, that's helpful. - That's wild. - The main thing about formalism is that you\nthink of the process of doing mathematics. You divorce it from the meaning of the mathematical assertions, right? So the\nmeaning of the mathematical assertions that you make in this infinitary theory has to do with these huge uncountable infinities and so on possibly.\nAnd that's a very sort of uncertain realm maybe and the source of the paradoxes\nand so on in some people's minds. But the reasoning process itself consists of writing down sequences of symbols\non your page and, you know, undertaking or, an argument with them which is following these finitary rules. And so,\nif we divorce the meaning of the symbols from just the process of manipulating the symbols, it's a way of looking at the nature of mathematics\nas a kind of formal game in which- the meaning may be totally absent. I don't think it's necessarily\npart of the formalist view that there is no meaning behind, but rather it's emphasizing that we can divorce the meaning of\nthe sentences from the process of manipulating those sentences. And then Hilbert wanted to prove in this purely finitary\ntheory that if we follow the rules of that game, we're never going to get a contradiction.\nSo those were the two aims of the Hilbert program, is to found the strong infinitary theory, probably set\ntheory, which is going to answer all the questions. And then secondly, prove in the finitary theory that the strong theory is\nsafe. In other words, consistent, yea",

    "text": "h? - What does the word \"finitary\" in finitary theory mean?\n- Yeah. Well, this is, of course, philosophically contentious, and people have different ideas about what exactly it should mean. So there's hundreds\nof papers on exactly that question. But I like to take it just kind of informally. I mean, it means that we're talking about finite sequences of\nsymbols, and we're going to have a theory, you know, finite strings of symbols. A finitary theory would be\none whose subject matter is about those kinds of things so that we can conceivably argue about the nature\nof these finite strings. A proof is just a finite sequence of statements, so that every statement is either one of the axioms or follows\nby the laws of logic from the earlier statements in some specified manner, like using modus ponens or some other law of logic like that.\nAnd such that the last line on the list is, you know, the theorem that you're proving. So that's what a proof is in this kind of way of thinking.\nTo take a specific example, I mean, I always conceive of the, perhaps the most natural finitary theory that one would be called upon to\nexhibit would be Peano arithmetic, the theory of Peano arithmetic, which- which is a first order theory of the nature of\narithmetic. But okay, so some people say, \"Well, Peano arithmetic has these strong first order induction axioms, and there's much,\nmuch weaker versions of arithmetic, like I-sigma-naught or I-sigma-1 and so on, which are even more finitary than Peano\narithmetic.\" So different philosophical positions take different attitudes about what is, what does it take to be finitary? How finitary do you\nhave to be to be truly finitary? - So according to Perplexity, Peano arithmetic is a foundational system for\nformalizing the properties and operations of natural numbers using a set of axioms called the Peano axioms. Peano arithmetic provides a\nformal language and axioms for arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication over the natural numbers. The axioms define the\nexistence of a first natural number, usually zero or one, the concept of a successor function, which generates\nthe next natural number, rules for addition and multiplication built from these concepts, the principle of induction allowing proofs around all\nnatural numbers, and it goes on. So it's a very particular kind of arithmetic that is finitary.\n- You know, in my... I view it as finitary, but this is a contentious view. Not everyone agrees with that. That's what I was trying to hint at.\n- Okay. I got it. All right. - Peano arithmetic is one of the hugely successful theories\nof the natural numbers and elementary number theory. Essentially, all of classical number theory, so\nwhatever kind of theorems you want to be proving about the prime numbers or factorization or any kind of finitary reasoning about\nfinite combinatorial objects, all of it can be formalized in Peano arithmetic. I mean, that's the basic situation. Of\ncourse, one has to qualify those statements ",

And one can think about, well, the incompleteness theorem should be viewed as a\ndecisive refutation of the Hilbert program. It defeats both of those goals decisively, completely. But before explaining\nthat, maybe one should think about, you know, what if Hilbert had been right? What would be the nature of mathematics in the world that Hilbert is telling us to search for?\n- And if I may, going to Perplexity's definition of Hilbert's program, it was David Hilbert's early 20th century project to give all\nof classical mathematics a completely secure finitary foundation. In essence, the goal was to formalize all of\nmathematics in precise axiomatic systems and then prove using only very elementary finitary reasoning\nabout symbols that these systems are free of contradiction. - Right. Exactly right. Let's imagine what it would be like if he had been\nright. So we would have this finitary theory, and it would prove that the strong theory was free of contradiction.\nSo we could start enumerating proofs from the strong theory. Right now, we can\nwrite a computer program that would systematically generate all possible proofs\nfrom a given theory. And so we could have, like, this theorem\nenumeration machine that would just spit out theorems all day long in such a manner that every single theorem would eventually be produced by this device.\nAnd so if you had a mathematical question of any kind, you could answer it by just\nwaiting for either the answer to come out yes or from the machine or the answer to come out no. So\nthe nature of mathematical investigation in Hilbert's world is one of just turning the crank of the theorem enumeration\nmachine, devoid of creative thinking or imagination, it's just getting the answer from this by rote.\nprocedure. So Hilbert, in effect, is telling us, I mean, with his program, that the\nfundamental nature of mathematics is rote computation. I mean, the way I think about the Hilbert program seems extremely attractive in the\nhistorical context of being worried about the antinomies, the inconsistencies, and so how can we kind of block them?\nIt seems natural, first of all, to have a strong theory that's going to answer all the questions, because the idea of logical independence and\npervasiveness that we now know exists just wasn't, you know, there was\nno known. They didn't know anything like that happening ever. And so it's natural to think that it wouldn't happen, and also\nthat they would be able to guard against this inconsistency.

And now you're saying, well, that\ndoesn't seem so unlikely maybe, I mean, in the light of the increasing computer power and so on, it's actually maybe turning into\nour everyday experience, where the machines are calculating more and more for us in a way that could be alarming. Okay. But, okay, so to talk about the\nalternative to the Hilbert point of view, I mean, if he's wrong, then what is the nature of mathematical reality? Well, it would mean\nthat we couldn't ever maybe, for the first goal, we couldn't ever write down a theory that answered all the\nquestions. So we would always be in a situation where our best theory, even the infinitary theories,\nwould have questions that they stumble with and are unable to answer. Independence would occur. But then also, because of\nthe failure of the second goal, we would also have to be constantly worrying about whether our theories were consistent or not, and we wouldn't\nhave any truly convincing means of saying that they were free from contradiction. And\nthe fact of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem shows that that is exactly the nature of\nmathematical reality, actually. Those are the two incompleteness theorems. So the first incompleteness theorem says you cannot write\ndown a computably axiomatizable theory that answers all the questions. Every such theory will be incomplete,\nassuming it includes a certain amount of arithmetic. And secondly, no such theory can ever prove its own consistency. So not only is\nit the case that the finitary theory can't prove the consistency of the strong infinitary theory, but even the infinitary theory can't prove\nits own consistency, right? That's the second incompleteness theorem. And so it's, in that sense, a decisive takedown of the Hilbert\nprogram, which is really quite remarkable, the extent to which his theorem just really answered that\nwhole puzzle. It's quite amazing. I mean, there's another aspect, kind of easy to think about.\nI mean, if you're wondering about theories that prove their own consistency, then, I mean, would you trust a theory\nthat proves of itself that it's consistent? I mean, that's like... it's like the used car salesman\ntelling you, \"Oh, I'm trustworthy.\" I mean, it's not a reason to trust the used car salesman, is it? Just because he says that.\nSo similarly, if you have a theory that proves its own consistency, well, even an inconsistent theory would prove its own consistency. And so it doesn't\nseem to be a logical reason to believe in the consistency, if you have a theory that proves itself consistent.\n- Just for clarification, you used the word theory. Is it, in this context, synonymous with axiomatic system?\n- Right. So in mathematical logic, \"theory\" is a technical term. And it means any set of sentences in a formal language. And so\nif you say axiomatic system, it's basically synonymous to my usage with theory",

People are sometimes unclear on whether they just mean the axioms or the consequences of the axioms, but...\n- So theory includes both the axioms and the consequences of the axioms, and you use it interchangeably and the context is supposed to\nhelp you figure out which of the two you're talking about? The axioms or the consequences? Or maybe to you, they're basically the same?\n- Yeah, well, they're so closely connected, although all the features aren't the same. So if you have a computable list of axioms for a theory, then you\ncan start enumerating the consequences of the axioms, but you won't be able to computably decide\nwhether a given statement is a consequence or not. You can enumerate the consequences, so you can semi-decide the\nconsequences, but you won't be able to decide yes or no whether a given statement is a consequence or not.\nSo it's the distinction between a problem being computably decidable and a problem being computably enumerable, which,\nwas made clear following the work of Turing and others that came from that. I mean, so that's one difference between the list of\naxioms of the theory and the theory itself. The axioms could be... You can decide, maybe computably, whether something is an axiom or not, but\nthat doesn't mean that you can decide computably whether or not something is a theorem or not. Usually, you only get to decide the positive\ninstances.

You know, there's so many questions to ask, like what is the difference between\nprovability and truth? What is true and what is provable? Maybe that's a good line to draw.\n- Yeah, this is a really core distinction that\nit's fascinating to me to go back and read even the early 20th century people before Gödel and Tarski,\nand they were totally sloppy about this distinction between truth and proof. It wasn't clear at all\nuntil Gödel, basically. Although even as late as Bourbaki has the kind of confusion in this\nfoundational work. So, this standard graduate-level textbook used in France in the presentation of logic, they are conflating truth and\nproof. To be true for them means to be provable. So, in the early days, maybe it wasn't clear enough that the concept of truth\nneeded a mathematical investigation or analysis. Maybe it was already taken to be fully clear.\nBut because of the incompleteness theorem, we realized that actually there's quite subtle things happening, right? And so, why don't we talk about\nthis distinction a bit? To me, it's absolutely core and fundamental to our und",

Truth has to do with the nature of reality. I\nmean, okay, when I talk about reality, I'm not talking about physical reality. I'm talking about mathematical reality. So, we have a concept of something being\ntrue in a structure, a statement being true in a mathematical structure. Like maybe you have the real field or something, and you want to know, does it satisfy this\nstatement or that statement? Or you have a group of some kind, or maybe you have a graph. This is a particular kind of mathematical structure\nthat has a bunch of vertices and edges, and you want to know does this graph satisfy that statement? And\nTarski gave this absolutely wonderful account of the nature of truth in what's now known as the disquotational\ntheory of truth. And what Tarski says is the sentence, \"Snow is white,\"\nis true if and only if snow is white. And what he means by that is, look, to say\ntruth is a property of an assertion, so we can think of the assertion as it syntactically. So, the sentence is true\nif and only if the content of the sentence is the case. You know? So, the sentence, \"Snow is white,\" you know, in quotations is true, that\njust means that snow is white. And that's why it's called the disquotational theory because we remove the quotation marks.\nfrom the assertion, right? And you can use this idea of disquotation to give a formal definition of truth in a\nmathematical structure of a statement in a formal language. So, for example, if I have a formal language that allows me to make atomic statements\nabout the objects and relations of the structure, and I can build up a formal language with, you know,\nwith the logical connectives of \"and\" and \"or\" and \"implies\" and \"not\" and so on, and maybe I have quantifiers, right? Then,\nfor example, to say that the structure satisfies phi and psi, that that single statement, phi\nand psi, I'm thinking of that as one statement, just means that it satisfies phi\nand it satisfies psi. And if you notice what happened there,\nI... At first, the 'and' was part of the sentence inside the sentence, but then in the second part, I was using the word\n'and' to refer to the conjunction of the two conditions. So- - Yeah, it has the disquotation. - Yeah, it has the disquotation.\nAnd so this idea can be done for all the logical connectors and quantifiers and everything. You're applying Tarski's idea of disquotation,\nand it allows you to define by induction the truth of any assertion in a formal language inside any mathematical structure. And\nso to say that a sentence is true, first of all, it's ambiguous unless you tell me which structure you're talking about it being true in.\nAnd so maybe we have in mind the standard model of arithmetic or something with the natural numbers and the arithmetic structure, and I want to know is a given statement\ntrue in that structure.

Proof, on the other hand, is, you know, in this Hilbert way of thinking, we can develop proof theory. What is\na proof for a mathematician, for a mathematical logician? A proof is a certain sequence or arrangement of sentences in the formal language that\naccord with the logical rules of a proof system. So there are certain modes of reasoning that are\nallowed. So if you know A and you know A implies B in the proof, then at a later step you're allowed to\nwrite B as a consequence. So if you know A and you know A implies B, those are both two statements that are known, then\nyou can deduce B as a consequence according to the rule of modus ponens. This is the rule of modus ponens. And, you know, there are a lot of other\nrules. Some people would call this implication elimination. There are different kinds of proof systems. There are a lot of different formal\nproof systems that exist that are studied by the proof theorists, and all of them have the property that they're sound, which means\nthat if the premises of the argument are all true in a structure and you have a proof to get a\nconclusion, then the conclusion is also true in that structure. So that's what it means to be sound. Proofs preserve truth. They're truth-\npreserving arguments. Okay? But also the proof systems are\nalso generally complete. They're both sound and complete, and complete means that whenever a statement is a consequence, a logical consequence of some\nother statements, which means that whenever the assumptions are true, then then the consequence is also true in the structure.\nSo whenever you have a logical consequence, then there is a proof of it. Okay? And the proof systems generally\nhave both of those properties; they're sound and complete. There's a third property a lot of logicians talk about\nsound and complete, sound and complete this, sound and complete that. But actually, there's a hidden third adjective that they should always be talking about in any such case, which is\nthat you should be able to recognize whether or whether or not something is a proof or not. So there's a computable aspect\nto the proof systems. We want to be able to recognize whether something is a proof. It should be computably decidable whether a given sequence of statements is a proof\nor not. So we don't want a proof system in which someone claims to have a proof, but we can't check that fact, whether\nit's a proof or not. We want to be able to correctly adjudicate\nall claims to having a proof. - Yeah.

Say, for the standard model of arithmetic where we have the natural\nnumbers and plus and times and zero, one, and less than, and so on. In that formal language, we can express an enormous number of\nstatements about the nature not only of arithmetic, but actually by various coding methods, we can express essentially all of finite\nmathematics in that structure. So the question would be, can we write down a computable list of axioms that will answer\nall those questions by proof? In other words, we want to have a complete theory, a theory of arithmetic that proves all and only the true\nstatements. That would be the goal. Hilbert would love that. I mean, that would be supportive of Hilbert's program to have such a complete\ntheory of arithmetic, and Godel proved that this is impossible. You cannot write down a computable list of axioms that is complete\nin that sense. There will always be statements... If the theory is consistent, there will always be statements that you cannot prove and you cannot\nrefute.

The Halting Problem is expressing a fundamental property of computational processes.

So given a program, we could run that\nprogram, but I want to pose it as a decision problem. Will this program ever complete its\ntask? Will it ever halt? And the Halting Problem is the question, given a program, will it halt? Yes or no? And, of course, for\nany one instance, the answer's either yes or no. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about whether there's a computable procedure to answer\nall instances of this question. So, it's a decision problem is given as a scheme of instances for all possible programs that you could ask\nabout. What I want to know is, is there a computable procedure that will answer those questions?\nAnd it turns out the answer's no. The Halting Problem is computably undecidable. There is no computable procedure that will correctly\nanswer all instances of whether a given program will halt. And of course, we can\nget half the answers in the sense that you give me a program and you say, \"Will this halt?\" And I could take that\nprogram and I could run it. And I could keep running it, and maybe in a week, it would\nhalt. And at that time, I could say, \"Yes, it halted.\" So I can get the yes answers correctly for halting, all the yes answers.\nBut the problem is if it didn't halt yet, like maybe I waited, you know, a thousand years\nand it still hasn't halted, I don't seem entitled to say, \"No, it's not going to halt.\" Yet, because\nmaybe in a thousand and one years, it'll halt. And so at no point can I seem to say, \"No.\" In order to say, \"No, it won't ever halt,\" it\nseems like I would have to really understand how the program worked and what it was doing.\nSo giving the \"yes\" answers was sort of trivial. You didn't have to understand it. You just needed to run it, which is a kind of rote task. But to give the \"no\" answers,\nyou need to have a kind of deep insight into the nature of the program and what it's doing in such a way that you would understand it and be able to see, \"Oh, no, I can\nsee this program is never gonna halt.\" Because, you know, it's a much more difficult task to say, \"No, it won't halt,\" than it is to say, \"Yes,\nit halted because I ran it and it halted.\" And it turns out to be impossible to have a computable procedure that gives\nthe \"no\" answers, you know?

So I don't\nhalt. If P halts on P, I don't halt. But if the answer came back, \"No, P is never gonna halt on P,\" then\nI halt immediately. Okay, so and that's it. I've described what Q does.\nAnd the thing about Q is that Q's behavior on P was the opposite of P's\nbehavior on P. I mean, that's how we designed Q specifically so that Q on P\nhad the opposite behavior as P on P. Okay, so now, of course, what do we do? Well, the same thing that\nRussell did and so forth, and Cantor, we ask, \"Well, what would Q do on\nQ?\" And because of this opposite behavior, Q would halt on Q if and only if Q does not halt on\nQ, which is a contradiction, because Q has to have the opposite behavior on Q than Q does, but that's just contradictory.\n- What a beautiful proof. Simple. - It's absolutely beautiful. Yeah, I agree. And it's following the\nsame logic of Russell and Cantor. I mean, going back to Cantor basically, because Russell is also quoting Cantor in\nCantor basically, because Russell is also quoting Cantor in his letter to Frege. So, therefore, the conclusion is that the halting problem is not computably\ndecidable. And now we can immediately prove Godel's decidable. And now we can immediately prove Gödel's theorem using this, actually. It's an immediate consequence. So why don't we just do that?\nI view this as the simplest proof I view this as the simplest proof of Gödel's theorem. You don't need the Gödel sentence to\nprove Gödel's theorem. You can do it with the halting problem. So, suppose\nthat we could write down a computable axiomatization of all that we could write down a computable axiomatization of all of the true facts of elementary mathematics, meaning arithmetic\nand finite combinatorial things such as Turing and finite combinatorial things such as Turing machine computations and so on. So in fact, all those\nfinite combinatorial processes are formalizable inside arithmetic with the finite combinatorial processes are formalizable inside arithmetic with the standard arithmetization coding proces",

I wasn't\nhappy with most of the other books that exist for those kind of courses, and the reason was that they were so often so dull because\nthey would concentrate on, like, these- totally uninteresting parts of what it's like to write a\nproof, these kind of mechanistic procedures about how to write a proof. You know, if you're going to prove an\nimplication, then you assume the hypothesis and argue for the conclusion, and so on. And all of that is true and fine and that's good to know, except if that's all that you're\nsaying about the nature of proof, then I don't think you're really learning very much. So I felt that it was possible to have a\nmuch better kind of book, one that was much more interesting and that had interesting theorems in\nit that still admitted of elementary proof. So I wrote this book and tried to fill it with all of the\ncompelling mathematical statements with very elementary proofs that exhibited lots of different proof styles in\nit. And so, I found that the students appreciated it a lot. - We should say, we dedicate the book to my students, may all their\ntheorems be true, proved by elegant arguments that flow effortlessly from hypothesis to conclusion while revealing fantastical mathematical beauty.\nAre there some interesting proofs that maybe illustrate,\nfor people outside of mathematics or for people who just take math classes- - Right - ...in high school and so on?\n- Yeah, let's do a proof.

So this is the\nfollowing problem.

So maybe you point at three of your friends or something and they point at two or three of their friends or whatever, and one person\nis pointing at 10 people and somebody isn't pointing at anybody maybe, or and various people are pointed at also, right? So the question is, could we arrange a pattern of\npointing so that everyone was more pointed at\nthan they are pointing at others? So in other words, maybe there's seven people pointing at me, but I'm only pointing at five people and\nmaybe there's, you know, 20 people pointing at you, but you're only pointing at 15 people or something like that, right? So I want to\nknow. There's a similar question on Twitter. For a group of people on Twitter, could you arrange\nthat everyone has more followers than following?

I think I give an induction proof\nand then there's another proof. I think there's three different proofs in there. But why don't we just talk about my favorite proof?\nSuppose it were possible to arrange that we're all more pointed at than pointing, okay? Now what we're going to do, we're going to agree,\nwe're going to give a dollar to everyone that we're pointing at. Okay? And so what happens? Everybody made money,\nbecause I was pointed at by more people than I'm pointing, so I got $10, but I only paid out $7. And similarly, you\ngot paid $20, but you only paid out $15. So, if everyone is more pointed at than pointing, then everyone makes money.\nBut it's obviously impossible for us to make money as a group by just trading money with ourselves.\nAnd therefore, it can't be possible that we're all more pointed at than pointing.\nAnd this proof illustrates something. It's one of my habits that I suggest in the book: to anthropomorphize your mathematical ideas.\nYou should imagine that the mathematical objects that are playing a role in your question are\npeople, or active, somehow, animals, or something that maybe have a will and a goal and so on.\nThis is this process of anthropomorphizing. And it often makes the problems easier to understand because we all\nare familiar with the fact that it's difficult to make money, and the proof is totally convincing because of our knowledge that\nwe can't make money as a group by trading dollars between us, you know, without any new money coming into the group.\nBut that by itself is actually a difficult mathematical claim. I mean, if someone had to\nprove that you can't make money by trading within a group, you know, it can't be that everyone in the group\nmakes money just by shifting money around in the group. Maybe you think that's obvious, and it is obvious if you think about money. But if you had asked the\nquestion, you know, about mathematical functions of a certain kind and so on, then maybe it wouldn't be as clear as it is when you're talking about this\nmoney thing, because of we can build on our human experience about the difficulty of getting\nmoney and, you know, or other resources. It doesn't have to be money, it could be candy, whatever. You know, we just know that you can't easily get\nmore things in that kind just by trading within a group. - And we should say that sometimes the power of proof is such that the\nnon-obvious can be shown, and then over time that becomes obvious. So in the context of money,\nor social systems, there's a bunch of things that are non-obvious. And the whole point is that proof can guide us\nto the truth, to the accurate description of reality. We just proved a property of money.\n- It's interesting to think about, ",

It's just, say, countable infinity in\neach case. If you had countably many friends and everyone has one dollar bill, then you can arrange a pattern of passing those dollar bills amongst each other so that afterwards\neveryone has infinitely many dollar bills. What you need is for each person to be attached to, you know, one of the train cars or\nsomething. So, think of everyone as coming from Hilbert's train, but also think of them as fitting into Hilbert's Hotel.

I mean, a huge part of the philosophy of mathematics is about this kind of question: what is the nature of\nthe existence of mathematical objects, including infinity? But I think asking about infinity specifically is\nnot that different than asking about the number five. What is— ...what does it mean for the number five to exist? What are the numbers\nreally, right? This is maybe one of the fundamental questions of mathematical ontology. I mean, there's many different positions to take on the question of the nature of\nthe existence of mathematical objects or abstract objects in general. And there's a certain kind of conversation that sometimes happens\nwhen you do that, and it goes something like this. Sometimes people find it\nproblematic to talk about the existence of abstract objects such as numbers, and there seems to be a kind of wish that we\ncould give an account of the existence of numbers or other mathematical objects or abstract objects that was more\nlike, you know, the existence of tables and chairs and rocks and so on.\nAnd so there seems to be this desire to reduce mathematical existence to\nsomething, you know, that we can experience physically in the real world. But my attitude about this attempt\nis that it's very backward, I think, because\nI don't think we have such a clear understanding of the nature of physical objects, actually. I mean, we all have experience\nabout existing in the physical world, as we must, because we do exist in the physical world, but I don't know of any\nsatisfactory account of what it means to exist physically.

I mean, except by saying, \"Oh, I just mean that it exists in the physical world.\" But what does that mean?\nThat's the question, right? It's not an answer to the question. That is the question. So I don't think that there's anything sensible that\nwe can say about the nature of physical existence. It is a profound mystery. In fact, it becomes more and more mysterious\nthe more physics we know. I mean, back in, say, Newtonian physics, one had a picture of the nature of physical objects\nas, you know, little billiard balls or something, or maybe they're infinitely divisible or something like that. Okay, but then this picture is upset with the\natomic theory of matter. But then that picture's upset when we realize that the atoms actually can be split and consist of electrons and\nprotons and neutrons and so on. But then that picture's upset when we realize that those things themselves are built out of quarks and leptons and so on, and\nwho knows what's coming. Furthermore, all of those things, the nature of their existence is actually as wave functions in\nyou know, some cloud of probability and so on. So it just becomes more and more and more mysterious the more we learn, and not at all\nclarifying. So the nature of what it means to say that, you know, there's an apple on my\ndesk, and to give an account of what that physical existence really is at bottom, I think, is totally absent. Whereas we\ndo seem to have a much more satisfactory account of the nature of abstract existence. I mean, I\ncan talk about the nature of the empty set. You know, this is the predicate which is never true or something like that. I can talk\nabout those kind of logical properties or the singleton of the empty set and so on. I mean, of course, it's very difficult if you go very\nfar with it, but the point is that it doesn't get more and more mysterious. The more that you say, it becomes only more and more clear. So it seems to me that,\nwe don't really have any understanding of what the physical world is as opposed to the abstract world, and it's the\nabstract world where existence is much more clear. - It is very true\nthat we don't know anything about the soda bottle or the steam locomotive just because we can poke at it. Again, we anthropomorphize, and that actually gets us into\ntrouble sometimes because I'm not feeling the quantum mechanics when I'm touching it. - That's right.\n- And therefore, it's easy to forget and feel like this is real and\nmathematical objects are not, but you're making the opposite argument.

Do numbers exist?\n- I happen to think so. I mean, I'm on the side of realism in mathematics, and I think that these abstract objects do have a real\nexistence in a way that we can give an account of, in a way I just tried to describe.\n- So, you would describe it as the size of a set with four elements in it? - Well, there are different ways to understand the nature of four. I mean, actually, this gets into\nthe question of structuralism, which is maybe a good place to talk about it.\n- What is structuralism? - Structuralism is a philosophical position in mathematics,\nor the philosophy of mathematics, by which one emphasizes that what's important about mathematical objects is not what they're made out of or\nwhat their substance or essence is, but rather how they function in a mathematical structure. And so, what I call the\nstructuralist attitude in mathematics is that we should only care about our mathematical structures up\nto isomorphism. If I have a mathematical structure of a certain kind, and I make an exact copy of it using different individuals\nto form the elements of that structure, then the isomorphic copy is just as good mathematically, and there's no\nimportant mathematical difference that would ever arise from working with this isomorphic copy instead of the original\nstructure. And so, therefore, that's another way of saying that the substance of individuals, you know, in a mathematical\nstructure is irrelevant with regard to any mathematical property of that\nstructure. And so, to ask a question like, \"What is the number four really?\" is an\nanti-structuralist thing because, you know, if you have if you have a structure, say, the natural numbers, you know, with all the numbers in it: 0,\n1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, then I could replace the number four with something else, like, you\nknow, this bottle of water could play the role of the number four in that structure, and it would be\nisomorphic. And it wouldn't matter at all for any mathematical purpose to use this alternative mathematical system, you know?\nThat's to say that we don't care what the number four is really. That is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is what are the\nproperties of the number four in a given mathematical system, you know, and recognizing that there are other isomorphic copies of that\nsystem, and the properties of that other system's number four are going to be identical to the properties of this system's number\nfour with regard to any question that's important about the number four. But those questions won't be about essence. So, in a sense,\nstructuralism is an anti-essential in mathematics. - So, is it fair to think of numbers as a kind of pointer to\na deep underlying structure? - Yeah, I think so, because I guess part of the point of\nstructuralism is that it doesn't make sense to consider mathematical objects or ind",

There's a famous question\nthat Frege had asked actually when he was looking into the nature of numbers, because in his logicist program, right, he was trying to\nreduce all of mathematics to logic. And in that process, he was referring to the Cantor-Hume\nprinciple that, you know, whenever two sets are equinumerous, then they have the same number of elements, I mean, if and only\nif. And he founded his theory of number on this principle, but he recognized that there was something that\ndissatisfied him about that situation, which is that the Cantor-Hume principle does not seem to give\nyou criteria for which things are numbers. It only tells you a kind of identity criteria for when two numbers are equal to\neach other. Well, two numbers are equal just in case the sets of those sizes are equinumerous, so that's the criteria for number\nidentity. But it is not a criteria for what is a number. And so this problem has become known as the Julius\nCaesar problem because Frege said we don't seem to have any way of telling\nfrom the Hume principle whether Julius Caesar is a number or not. So he's asking about the essence of number and\nwhether... Of course, one has a sense that he picked maybe what he was trying to\npresent as a ridiculous example, because maybe you have the idea that well, obviously Julius Caesar is not a\nnumber, and there's a lot of philosophical writing that seems to take that line also, that obviously the answer is that Julius Caesar is not a\nnumber. But the structuralists disagree with that position. The structuralist attitude is,\n\"Look, you give me a number system. If Julius Caesar isn't a number, then\nI can just... let's take the number 17 out of that system and plug in Julius Caesar for that role, and now I've got a new number system, and\nnow Julius Caesar happens to be the number 17.\" And that's totally fine, you know. So the point of\nstructuralism is is that the question of whether Julius Caesar is a number or not is irrelevant to\nmathematics. It is irrelevant because it is not about structure, it's about this essence of the mathematical objects.\nSo that's the structuralist criticism of Frege's point. - You've kind of made the case that you can\nsay more concrete things about the existence of objects in mathematics than you can in our physical reality, about which to us human brains,\nthings are obvious or not. So what's more real? The reality we see with our eyes or the reality we can express in mathematical theorems?\n- I'm not quite sure. I mean, I live entirely in the Platonic realm, and I don't\nreally understand the physical universe at all. So I don't have strong views.\n- Let's talk about the Platonic realm.

I mean, there were other people who know\nsome logic, particularly from category theory and other parts of mathematics that aren't in the most traditional parts of\nlogic, but they were answering some of the logic questions. So I really found myself able to make a contribution in those very early days by\nengaging with the logic-related questions. But there weren't many logic people asking questions either. But what I found was\nthat there was an enormous amount of interest in topics that were logic-adjacent. So a\nquestion would arise, you know, in group theory, but it had a logic aspect or an analysis or whatever, and there would be some logic\nangle on it. And what I found was that I was often able to figure out an answer by learning enough about\nthat other subject matter. This is what was so rewarding for me, because basically I had to learn enough. had to learn enough. My expertise, my main expertise was\nlogic, but someone would ask a question, you know, that, that was about, say, the axiom of choice in this other subject\nmatter or the continuum hypothesis or something like that in an, in the other subject matter. And I would have to learn enough about that other subject and\nthe context of the question in order to answer and I was often able to do that. And so I was quite happy to do that. And, and also\nI learned a lot by doing that because I had to learn about these other problem areas. And so it really\nallowed me to grow enormously as a mathematician. - To give some examples of questions you've answered, what are some reasonable\nsounding statements that are independent of ZFC? What are the most misleading alternate definitions in taught mathematics? Is\nthe analysis as taught in universities in fact the analysis of definable numbers?

We've touched on it a little\nbit, but it would be nice to lay out what is the continuum hypothesis that Cantor struggled with. And I would love to also speak to the\npsychology of his- his own life story, his own struggle with it. It's the human side of mathematics is also fascinating.\nSo what is the continuum hypothesis? - So the continuum hypothesis is the question that arises\nso naturally whenever you prove that there's more than one size of infinity. So Cantor proved that the infinity of the real numbers is strictly larger\nthan the infinity of the natural numbers. But immediately when you prove that,\none wants to know, well, is there anything in between? I mean, what could be a more natural question to ask\nimmediately after that? And so Cantor did ask it, and he spent his whole life thinking about this question. And so the continuum hypothesis\nis the assertion that there is no infinity in between the natural numbers and the real numbers. And, of course, Cantor knew many sets\nof real numbers. Everything in between... I mean, everything that's in that interval would be equinumerous with some set of real\nnumbers. But we know lots of sets of real numbers. I mean, there's all these various closed sets, Cantor sets, and so on. There's Vitali sets. We have all kinds of\nsets of real numbers. And so you might think, well, if the continuum hypothesis is false, then we've probably seen the- the set already. We just have\nto prove, you know, that it's strictly in between. But it turned out that for all the sets that anyone ever could define or pick\nout or observe, for all the sets of real numbers, it was always the case either that they were countable, in which case they're equinumerous\nwith the natural numbers or else finite. Or they were fully equinumerous with the whole real line. And so\nthey were never strictly in between. I mean, you're in this situation and you have 100, thousands of sets that are\ncandidates to be in between, but in every single case, you can prove it's on one side or the other\nand not strictly in between. And so in every situation where you're able to figure out whether it's in between or not, it's\nalways never strictly in between. - Now, Cantor was obsessed with this.\n- I think he was. Yeah, I'm not a historian, so I don't know the exact history. - Well, everything I've seen, it seems to be the question that broke him, huh? Um,\nI mean, just struggling with different opinions on the hypothesis within himself and... ...Desperately chasing, trying to prove it.\n- So he had a program for proving it, which has been affirmed in a certain respect. Of course, the continuum hypothesis holds\nfor open sets. That's easy to see. If you have an open interval, then this is fully equinumerous with the whole\nreal line. Any interval is equinumerous with the whole line because all you would need is a function, you know, like the arctangen",

So we know the open sets\nhave the property that their non-trivial open sets are all fully equinumerous with the whole real line. So, never strictly in between.\nBut remarkably, Cantor proved it also for the closed sets, and that is using what's called the Cantor-Bendixson theorem. So,\nit's quite a remarkable result. It's definitely not obvious. And in this theorem actually was the origin of the ordinals. Cantor\nhad to invent the ordinals in order to make sense of his Cantor-Bendixson process.\n- Can you define the open and the closed set in this context? - Oh, yeah. Sure. So a set of reals is open if every\npoint that it contains is surrounded by a little interval of points, the whole tiny little interval. But that\ntiny little interval is already just by itself equinumerous with the whole line. So that's why that question is sort of easy for open sets. A closed\nset is a complement of an open set, and there's a lot of closed sets that are really complicated of varying\nsizes. So of course, any closed interval is a closed set, but it's not only those. There's also things like the Cantor set, which you get by omitting middle\nthirds. Maybe some people have seen this construction. Or you can imagine sort of randomly taking a lot of little tiny\nopen intervals, you know, all over the line and so on. So that altogether would be an open set, and the complement of it would be a closed set. So you can imagine just\nkind of tossing down these open intervals, and what's left over is the closed set. Those sets can be quite complicated, and they can have\nisolated points, for example, if the two open intervals were just kissing and leaving only the one point between them. But also you could\nhave sequences that are converging to a point, that would also be a closed set, or convergent sequences of convergent\nsequences and so on. That would be a closed set also. - The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing open intervals, middle thirds,\nlike you mentioned, from the interval, and trying to see, can we do a thing that that goes in between?\n- Right. So the question would be, can you produce a set that has an intermediate size? an intermediate cardinality, right?\nAnd Cantor proved, with the closed set, \"No, it's impossible.\" Every closed set is either countable or equinumerous with the whole real line.\nAnd the Cantor program for solving the Continuum Hypothesis was,\na sort of working up. So you did it for open sets and for closed sets, and you sort of work up. Maybe he wants to go into what are called the Borel sets,\nwhich are sort of combinations of open and closed sets. And there's a vast hierarchy of Borel complexity. And it\nturns out that the Continuum Hypothesis has been proved also for the Borel sets in this hierarchy. But then one wants to go beyond.\nWhat about more complicated sets? So there's this hierarchy of complexity for sets of real numbers. And",

And that has been carried out to a remarkable degree. It turns out that one begins to need\nlarge cardinal assumptions, though, in order to get to the higher realms, even at the level of projective hierarchy,\nwhich are sets that you can define by using quantifiers over the real numbers themselves. So you get this hierarchy on top of the Borel hierarchy,\nthe hierarchy of projectively definable sets. And it turns out that if you have enough large cardinals, then the projective sets\nalso are always either countable or equinumerous with the whole real line. And then one can try to go beyond this and so\non. So I view all of those results which came, you know, in the past 50 years, the later ones, as fulfilling this Cantor idea that goes back,\nyou know, 120 years to his idea that we would prove the Continuum Hypothesis by establishing more and more instances for greater and\ngreater complexity of sets. But of course, even with what we know now, it hasn't fully succeeded and it\ncan't because the hierarchy of complexity doesn't include all sets of real numbers. Some of them are, sort of, transcending this hierarchy\ncompletely, in a way. And so the program can't ever fully be successful, especially in light\nof the independence result. - Yeah. Well, spoiler alert, can you go to the independence result?\n- Sure. - So what does that mean? So the Continuum Hypothesis was shown to be independent from the ZFC axioms of mathematics?\n- Right. So the ZFC axioms were the axioms that were put forth first by Zermelo in 1908 in regard to his\nproof of the well-order theorem using the axiom of choice. That wasn't fully ZFC. At that time, it was just Zermelo theory because he\nsort of... There was a kind of missing axiom, the replacement axiom, and the foundation axiom were added later, and that's what makes the Zermelo-Fraenkel\naxiomatization, which became, sort of, standard. Actually, there's another aspect, which is Zermelo's original theory allowed\nfor the existence of ur-elements, or these atoms, mathematical objects that are not sets\nbut out of which we build the set theoretic universe, whereas set theorists today generally don't use ur-elements at all. I,\nI argue that it's really the philosophy of structuralism that leads them to omit the ur-elements because it turns out that\nif you adopt ZFC axioms with ur-elements, ZFCU it's called, or ZFA, then any\nstructure that exists, any mathematical structure that exists in that set theoretic universe with the atoms is isomorphic to a structure that doesn't use the atoms at all.\nAnd you don't need the atoms if you're a structuralist because you only care about the structures up to isomorphism anyways, and the theory is simply more\nelegant and clear without the atoms. They're just not needed. And so that's why today",

These are expressing the main principle ideas that we have about the nature of sets and set existence. And\nHardest problems in mathematics\nCanter had asked about the continuum hypothesis in the late 19th century, and it remained open, totally open until 1938.\n- We should mention, I apologize, that it was the number one problem in the Hilbert's 23 set of problems formulated at the\nbeginning of the century. - That's right. - Maybe you can comment on why did he put that as number one. - So... Right. So Hilbert had introduced at his famous address at the\nturn of the century this list of problems that he thought could guide or were important to consider in the\ncoming century of mathematics. I mean, that's how people talk about it now, although I'm not sure at all... Of course, I can't really speak for Hilbert at all, but if\nyou were a very prominent mathematician, I find it a little hard to believe that Hilbert would have conceived of his list\nin the same way that we now take his lists. I mean, having observed the century unfold, we know that that list of\n23 problems did in fact guide whole research programs, and it was extremely important and influential. But at the time, Hilbert\nwould have no reason to think that that would be true, and he was just giving a lecture and had a list of problems that\nhe thought were very important. And so I tend to I would find it more reasonable to think that he was just making a list of problems that he thought were\nextremely interesting and important and fundamental in a way without the kind of heavy burden of\nguiding this 20th century research. Although it turns out that in fact that's exactly what they did.\nAnd we already discussed how Hilbert's views on the nature of set theory and the fundamental character, that quote\nwhere he said, \"No one will cast us from the paradise that Canter has created for us.\" So, so I think\nHilbert was convinced by Canter on the importance and the fundamental nature of the continuum hypothesis for the foundations of mathematics,\nwhich was a critically important development for the unity of mathematics. I mean, before set theory emerged as a foundation of mathematics,\nyou know, there are different subjects in mathematics. There's algebra and there's analysis, real analysis, and topology and\ngeometry, and so on. There are all these disparate subjects with their own axioms, separate axioms, right?\nAnd sometimes it happens, like when you're proving, say, the fundamental theorem of algebra, you know, that the complex numbers are an algebraically closed\nfield that you can solve any polynomial equation in. But the proof methods for that theorem come from\nother parts of mathematics. You know, those topological proofs and so on. And so how does that\nwork?

So the unity of mathematics was provided by the\nexistence of a mathematical foundation like set theory. And at the time, it was set theory. And so it's critically important to be able to have a\nsingle theory in which one views all of mathematics as taking place to resolve that kind of transfer and borrowing\nphenomenon that was definitely happening. So that must have been part of Hilbert's thinking about why it's so important to have a uniform\nfoundation, and set theory was playing that role at the time. Now, of course, we have other possible foundations coming from category theory or type\ntheory, and there's univalent foundations now. So there are sort of competing foundations now. There's no\nneed to just use one foundation, one set theoretic foundation. Although set theory continues to, in my view, have an extremely successful\nmeta-mathematical analysis as a foundation, I think is much more successful than set theory for any of those other foundations, but\nit's much less amenable though to things like computer proof and so on, which is part of the motivation to find these alternative foundations. So, yeah, okay, so\njust to talk about Hilbert though, I think he was motivated by the need for a unifying foundation of\nmathematics, and set theory was playing that role, and the continuum hypothesis is such a core, fundamental question to ask, so it\nseems quite natural that he would put it on the list. There were other logic-related questions though, like Hilbert's tenth problem is also related to logic.\nThis is the question about Diophantine equations, and he asked to provide an algorithm to decide whether a given\nDiophantine equation has a solution in the integers. So a Diophantine equation is just, I mean, it's maybe a fancy way of talking about\nsomething that's easy to understand, a polynomial equation, except it's not just one variable, many variables.\nSo you have polynomials in several variables over the integers, and you want to know, can you solve it? So the problem is,\nas stated by Hilbert, to provide an algorithm for answering the question whether a given\npolynomial equation has a solution in the integers. So he's sort of presuming that there is an algorithm, but he wants to know what it\nis. What is the algorithm? But the problem was solved by proving that there is no\nalgorithm. It's an undecidable problem, like the halting problem. There is no computable procedure that will correctly decide whether a given\npolynomial equation has a solution in the integers. So that's quite a remarkable development, I think. There were also a few other\nlogic-related questions on the list. - And so eventually, continuum hypothesis was shown to be independent from ZFC\naxioms, as we've mentioned. So, how does that make you feel? What is independence, and what does that mean?\n- But once you tell the story, the historical story... - Yes - ...is really quite dramatic. - Ye",

This is the same result where he answers the safety question of the axiom of choice, but\nalso for the continuum hypothesis. They're true in the same set theoretic universe\nwe get. So if ZF, without the axiom of choice, is consistent, then so is ZFC plus the continuum hypothesis is the result. 1938. It's really such a beautiful\nargument. It's just incredible, I think, because he's building an alternative mathematical\nreality. That's the structure of the proof, is that, okay, if there's any mathematical reality, if there's any set theoretic\nworld, then we're going to build another one, a separate one, a different one, maybe different. Maybe it's the same as the original one, it could be.\nIf we started already in the one that he built, then it would be the same. But there's no reason to assume it was the same.

And then\nhe proves that the axiom of choice is true there, and also the continuum hypothesis is true there, and it's just amazing.

He showed\nthat if set theory is consistent... without the continuum hypothesis, then it's consistent with the continuum hypothesis.\nSo that's not the same thing as proving that it's true. Yeah.

So what can you do about the\nthings that are shown to be independent from ZFC? - Right.

For any\ntheory that we can write down, there's going to be things that we can't prove, true things we can't prove in it. So there's those things are gonna be\nindependent.

So that's called the consistency-strength hierarchy.\nSo it's a direct consequence of Gödel's second incompleteness theorem that for any theory we can write down, then towering over it is this\nincredibly tall tower of consistency strength, where the strength in theories aren't just adding another\naxiom, but they're adding another axiom even whose consistency was not provable in the previous layers of the hierarchy.\nSo, and so how lucky we are to find the large cardinal axioms that instantiate exactly this feature of increasing\nconsistency strength, this unending and extremely tall hierarchy of consistency\nstrength of axioms.

And the answer, regrettably, is apparently not because\nin calculus, even with that lousy, creaky foundation of infinitesimals not even\nwell understood that Newton and Leibniz had, they proved all the fundamental theorems of calculus and, you know, they had all the main insights\nin those early days with that extremely bad foundation. And so that shows you something about the relevance of the kind of\nfoundational views on mathematics and how important they are for mathematical developments and progress and insight. I mean, because I\nview those early mathematical developments in calculus as genuinely mathematical and extremely important\nand insightful, even though the foundations weren't any good, from, you know, by contemporary perspectives. Okay.\nSo, rather... So when it comes to the philosophy of set theory and the dispute between the universe view and the pluralism, my view is that the choice\nof the philosophical perspective doesn't actually have to do with the mathematical developments directly at all. Rather, it\ntells us, \"Where should set theory go? What kind of set theory should we be looking at? What kind of\nquestions should we be asking?\" So if you have a universe mentality, the universe view, then you're\ngonna be pushed to try to find and articulate the nature of the one true set-theoretic universe.\nAnd I think that remark is really well borne out by the developments with Hugh Woodin, who's one of the most prominent mathematicians\nand philosophers with the universe view and his theory of ultimate L and so on. And he's really striving.\n- Who was also your advisor. - He was also my supervisor. My graduate supervisor. - Which is a, a personal story as well.\n- This, this fundamental dispute, yeah, on this question. he is uh, has a very strong and successful\nresearch program, sort of trying to give legs to finding the nature of the one true set theoretic\nuniverse. And it's driving the questions that he's asking and the mathematical programs that he's pursuing. Whereas if you have a\npluralist view, as I do, then you're gonna be led and attracted to questions that have to do with the interaction of\ndifferent set theoretic universes. Or maybe you wanna understand the nature of how are the models of set theory related to their\nforcing extensions and so on. And so this led to things, um that I call, say, set theoretic po",

Not in the sense of potential infinity directly, because all of these universes have\ninfinite sets inside them already. But they're potentialist in the sense that we could have more sets. The universe could be wider\nand taller and so on, you know, by forcing or by extending upward. And so we wanna understand the nature of\nthis realm of set theoretic universes. And, and that's quite some exciting work. And so with\nBenedikt Loewe and I, we proved some theorems on the modal logic of forcing and set theoretic potentialism under end extension. I've done a bunch\nof work on this topic. And, and also I I mounted together with Gunter Fuchs and Jonas Riets, who was one of my own PhD students, the topic of set theoretic\nmy own PhD students, the topic of set theoretic geology, which is studying... It's taking the metaphor of\nforcing. I mean, in forcing, you have the ground model and the forcing extension. And when I was first working with Jonas\nhe said, \"I wanna undo forcing. I wanna go backwards.\" And I at first said, \"But Jonas, it doesn't work\nthat way. You start in the model, in the ground model, and you go out, you go to the bigger one. bigger one. You know, that's how forcing works.\" And he said, \"No, no, I wanna go\nbackwards.\" And, and so he was quite persistent, actually. And um, and so finally, I said, \"Okay, let's, let's do it. Let's\ntake it seriously.\" And so we sat down and, and s- and started thinking, you know, more precisely and carefully and deeply about the nature\nof taking a set theoretic universe and seeing where did it come from by forcing, which was a new way of thinking about forcing at the time.\n- Like reverse engineering the forcing? - Yeah, something like that. Forcing is a way of producing a new\nuniverse. And so you could start somewhere and go to that new universe, or you could look where you are and say, \"Well, look, I got here by doing that already in the past.\"\nSo we defined models of the bedrock model and ground, you know, sort of undoing the forcing. And, and\nreally, it was quite fruitful. And I view this as part of the sort of pluralist perspective, except the difference is that set theoretic geology is\namenable to the universe view. So even though the work was inspired by this philosophical view on the multiverse view, nevertheless, the\ncentral ideas of geology have now been picked up by the people with the research program in the universe view. Because it turns\nout that set theoretic geology is helping them or us to discover the nature of the one true universe relates to its\nmantle. There's this concept of the set theoretic mantle that I had introduced in a way that is extremely interesting. And so it's\nhistorically quite funny, I think, because this research program that grew entirely out of the pluralist point of\nview ended up being picked up by the universe point of view research program in a, in a way that is quite important.\n- Can you pro",

And that's a really powerful argument method, actually. People often\nwant to do that. Suppose you're in some set theoretic context. You know, you could think about as living in a set theoretic\nuniverse, and you want to prove something in that universe only. But maybe one way to do it is to first\nconstruct this forcing extension and then use the features about this forcing extension to realize that certain things must have already been\ntrue in the ground model. And then you throw the forcing extensions away and you... - Oh, cool - ...yeah. So this can happen. To pick a more elementary\nexample, if you think about the early days of people reasoning with the complex numbers before they really understood them.\nSo they would have these algebraic equations that they're trying to solve, you know, and they would have the tools and methods of\ndoing it, but then in the course of, you know, so they would have to do things to the polynomial and change the factors and so on, and produce other polynomials and solve them and\nso on. And sometimes, they could produce solutions.\nin the middle of their construction, they were led to, like, the square root of minus five or something, you know, in the\nconstruction. And they didn't have any meaning for that, but they would just do it symbolically, you know. And, and\neventually, it would turn in, you know, because of the methods that they had, they would combine and they would cancel and so on, and all the complex parts would cancel out and they'd end\nup with this, you know, actual answer, you know, three plus square root of 17 or whatever. And, and they could check it and it worked. It was\na solution of the original equation. And so it must have been bewildering to them because they would start with this question purely\nin the real numbers, an algebraic question, and they would march on their method and proceed through the land of nonsense, you\nknow, with these square roots of negative numbers and then end up with an answer that was real again that they could verify was correct.\nAnd so, I view this kind of forcing argument that I was just describing in a similar way. You start in set theory, and you go to\nthis land of nonsense in the forcing extension, this imaginary world. And you argue and you come back. I mean, you make a consequence in the ground model,\nand it's such a beautiful way of arguing. - So, speaking of the land of nonsense, I have to ask you about surreal numbers, but\nfirst, I need another bathroom break. All right, we're back, and there's this aforementioned\nSurreal numbers\nwonderful blog post on the surreal numbers, and\nthat there's quite a simple surreal number generation process that can basically construct all numbers.\nSo, maybe this is a good spot to ask, what are surreal numbers and what is the way we can generate all numbers?\n- So, the surreal number system is an a",

    "text": "mazing, amazingly beautiful mathematical system that was introduced by John Conway.\n- Rest in peace, one of the great mathematicians ever on this earth. - Yes, absolutely. And I really admire his\nstyle of mathematical thinking and working in mathematics, and the surreal number system is a good instance of this. So, the way I think about the\nsurreal numbers system is what it's doing is providing us a number system that unifies all the other number systems. So, it\nextends the real numbers. Well, not only, it extends the integers, the natural numbers and the integers and the rational numbers, and the real\nnumbers, but also the ordinals and the infinitesimals. So, they're all sitting there inside the surreal numbers, and\nit's this colossal system of numbers. It's not a set even. It's a proper class, it turns out, because it contains all\nthe ordinal numbers. But it's generated from nothing\nby a single rule, and the rule is, so we're gonna generate the numbers in stages, in transfinite sequence of\nstages. And at every stage, we take the numbers that we have so far and in all possible ways, we divide them into\ntwo sets, a lower set and an upper set, or a left set and a right set. So we divide them into these two sets, so that\neverything in the left set is less than everything in the right set, and then at that moment, we create a new number that fits in the gap\nbetween L and R. Okay? That's it. That's all we do. So, let me say it again.\nThe rule is, we proceed in stages, and at any stage, then in all possible ways, we divide the\nnumbers we have into two collections, the left set and the right set, so that everything in the left set is less than everything in the right\nset. And we create a new number, a new surreal number that will fit in that gap.\nOkay. So, for example, we could start... At the beginning, we don't have any numbers. We haven't created anything yet, and so, well,\nwe could take nothing, and we could divide it into two sets, the empty lower set and the empty upper set. I mean, the two empty sets.\nAnd everything in the empty set is less than everything in the empty set because that's a vacuous statement. So we satisfy the conditions,\nand we apply the number generation rule, which says we should create a new number. And this is what I call the Big Bang of\nnumbers, the surreal genesis when the number zero is born. Zero is the firstborn number that is bigger than\neverything in the empty set and less than everything in the empty set. Okay, but now we have this number zero, and so\ntherefore, we now can define new gaps. Because if we put zero into the left set and have an\nempty right set, then we should create a new number that's bigger than zero and less than everything in the empty set, and that number is called the number\none. And similarly, at that same stage, we could have put zero into the right set,\nand so that would be the firstborn number that's less than zero, which is called minus one. So now we have three numbers, minus one,\nzero and o",

The first number above one is called two. The first number between zero and one\nis called 1/2, and then on the negative side, we have minus 1/2 and minus two and so on. So now we have, what is that, seven numbers?\nseven numbers. So there's eight gaps between them. So at the next birthday, they call them, the next stage will be born all the numbers\nbetween those gaps, and then between those and between those and so on. And as the days progress, we get more and more\nnumbers, but those are just the finite birthdays, because as I said, it's a transfinite process. So at day omega, that's the\nfirst infinite day, we're going to create a lot of new surreal numbers. So every real number will\nbe born at that stage because every real number fills a gap in the previously born rational numbers that we had just talked\nabout. It's not all the rationals, because actually the rational numbers that are born at the finite stages are just the rationals whose denominator is a power of\ntwo, it turns out. Those are called the dyadic rationals. So the real numbers are all born on day omega,\nbut also some other numbers are born on day omega, namely, the ordinal omega itself is the firstborn number that's bigger than all those\nfinite numbers, and minus omega is the firstborn number that's less than all those finite numbers. But also, we have\nthe number epsilon, which is the firstborn number that's strictly bigger than zero and strictly less than all the positive rational\nnumbers. So that's going to be an infinitesimal number in that gap, and so on. On day omega plus one, we\nget more numbers, and then omega plus two and so on. And the numbers just keep coming forever. So, this is how you build the surreal number\nsystem. And then it turns out you can define the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication in a natural way that\nis engaging with this recursive definition. So we have sort of recursive definitions of plus and times for the\nsurreal numbers. And it turns out you can prove that they make the surreal numbers into what's called an ordered\nfield. So they satisfy the field axioms, which means that you have distributivity and commutativity of addition and multiplication.\nmultiplication, and also you have reciprocals for every non-zero number. You can divide by the number. So you can add\nand multiply and divide and subtract. And furthermore, you can take square roots. And furthermore, every odd degree polynomial has a root,\nwhich is true in the real numbers, because if you think about, say, a cubic or a fifth degree polynomial, then you know it's going to cross the\naxis, because it has opposite behaviors on the two infinities, because it's an odd degree polynomial. So on the positive side,\nit's going to the positive infinity. On the negative side, it would be going to minus infini",

So that makes it what's called a\nreal closed field, which is a very nice mathematical theory. So it's really quite interesting how we can find copies\nof all these other number systems inside the surreal numbers. - But the surreal numbers are fundamentally discontinuous as you're worried about.\nWhat are the consequences of this? - Right. So the surreal numbers have a property that they form\na non-standard model of the real field, which means that\nthey provide a notion of infinitesimality that one can use to develop calculus on the grounds of Robinson's non-standard theory that I had\nmentioned earlier. But they don't have the least upper bound property for subcollections. There's\nno set of surreal numbers, no non-trivial set of surreal numbers has at least upper bound, and there are no convergent sequences in\nthe surreal numbers. And so for the sort of ordinary use in calculus based on limits and\nconvergence, that method does not work in the surreal numbers at all. So that's what I mean when I say the surreal numbers are fundamentally\ndiscontinuous. They have a fundamental discontinuity going on. But you can still do calculus with them, because you have\ninfinitesimals if you use these non-standard methods, the infinitesimal-based methods to calculus. And\npeople do that. I once organized a conference in New York, and we had John Conway as a speaker at that conference. And there\nwas a question session, and someone asked him, I mean, it's a bit rude, I think, but they\nasked it and the question was, \"What is your greatest disappointment in life?\" I mean, I would never ask a question like that at a conference\nin a very public setting. But Conway was extremely graceful, and he answered by saying that,\n\"The surreal numbers...\" Not the numbers themselves, but the reception of the surreal numbers, because he had ambition that the\nsurreal numbers would become a fundamental number system used throughout mathematics and science, because it was able to do\nnon-set analysis, it was able to do calculus, it unified the ordinals and so on. And it's such a unifying, amazing structure, beautiful structure\nwith elegant proofs and sophisticated ideas all around it. And he was disappointed that it never really achieved that unifying\nstatus that he had the ambition for. And this, he mentioned as his greatest disappointment.\n- Yeah, Donald Knuth tried to celebrate it. It never quite took hold. - So I don't want to give the impression though that the surreal numbers are not widely studied,\nbecause there are thousands of people who are... - Sure - ...studying it. In fact, Philip Ehrlich, who is one of the world experts on\nthe surreal numbers, mentioned to me once that Conway was his own worst enemy with regard to that very issue, because\nin the Conway style, everything is a game.

And I just find the whole subject so\nfascinating and beautiful. I mean, it's true. I'm not applying it in engineering, which maybe was part of this Conway ambition.\n- And I just wanted to, before I forget, mention the Conway, turning everything into a game. It is a fascinating\nConway's Game of Life\npoint that I didn't quite think about, which I think the Game of Life is just an example of exploration of cellular automata. I think cellular automata is one of the\nmost incredible, complicated, fascinating... It feels like an open door into a world we have not quite yet explored. And it's such\na beautiful illustration of that world, the Game of Life, but calling it a game, maybe life balances it, 'cause that's your powerful word,\nbut it's not quite a game. It's a fascinating invitation to an incredibly complicated and fascinating mathematical\nworld. I think every time I see cellular automata and the fact that we don't quite have mathematical tools to make sense\nof that world, it fills me with awe. Speaking of a thousand years from now, it feels like that is a world we might make some progress on.\n- The Game of Life is a sort of playground for computably undecidable questions because in fact, you can prove that the\nquestion of whether a given cell will ever become alive is computably undecidable. In other words,\ngiven a configuration and you ask, \"Will this particular cell ever you know, be alive?\" \"...in the evolution?\" And you can prove that that\nquestion is equivalent to the Halting Problem. It's computably undecidable. It's semi-decidable in the sense that if it will\nbecome alive, then you will know it at a finite stage because you could just run the Game of Life algorithm and let it run. And if it ever did come\nalive, you could say, \"Yeah, it was alive.\" But if you've run it for a thousand years and it hasn't come alive yet, then you don't necessarily seem to\nhave any basis for saying, \"No, it won't ever come alive\" if the behavior was very complicated. Maybe if you have a complete understanding of the evolution of the behavior, then you can say\nno, but you can prove you won't always have that understanding- ... precisely because the problem is equivalent to the halting problem.\n- And nevertheless, when you sit back and look and visualize the thing, some little mini cellular automata civilizations are born and die quickly,\nand some are very predictable and boring, but some have this rich incredible complexity. And maybe that\nspeaks to a thing I wanted to ask on the halting problem and decidability.\nComputability theory\nYou've mentioned this thing where if you understand the program deeply, you might be able to say something.

    "text": "now something about in terms of whether they halt or not? Or what does it mean to\nunderstand a program deeply enough to be able to make a prediction? - The main lesson of computability theory in my view\nis that it's never the case that you can have a thorough\nunderstanding of the behavior of a program by looking at the program, and that the content of what you learn from\na program, I mean, in the most general case, is always obtained just by running it and looking at the behavior. And the\nproof of that is there's a theorem called Rice's Theorem, which makes that idea completely robust. But I want to just take a little detour towards\nanother question riffing on something that you just said. Namely, one can ask the question,\nWhat is the behavior of a random program? So you have some formal computing language, you know, and you want to, you know, look\nat the collection of all programs of a certain size. Maybe there's only finitely many. And\ncan you say something about the behavior of a randomly chosen one, like with a certain likelihood it will have a certain behavior? And the answer turns out\nto be extremely interesting. Once years ago, Alexey Myasnikov asked me a question. He had this concept of a\ndecision problem with a black hole, and what that means is it's a decision problem which is possibly difficult in the worst\ncase, but the difficulty was concentrated in a very tiny region called the black hole. And outside of that black hole, it was very easy.\nAnd so, for example, this kind of problem is a terrible problem to use if you're basing your encryption scheme, you know, you don't\nwant to use a black hole problem because if someone can rob the bank 95% of the time, you know, then that's not what you want,\nor even any non-trivial percent of the time is too dangerous. So you don't want to use problems that are, you know, almost every case is easily\nsolved as the basis of your encryption. And the question Alexey asked me was, \"Does the halting problem have a black\nhole?\" You know? And so if we take, say, the standard model of Turing machines, it's one-way infinite tape with zeros\nand ones on the tape and so on, the head moving back and forth, and you know, it stops when it gets into the halt state, then it turns\nout we proved that there is a black hole. And what that means is there's a computer procedure that decides correctly\nalmost every instance of the halting problem. Even though the halting problem is not decidable, we can decide almost every instance. So, more\nprecisely, there's a collection of Turing machine programs such that we can easily decide whether a program's in that\ncollection or not. And for the programs in the collection, we can decide the halting problem for those programs\neasily. And furthermore, almost every program is in the collection in the sense that as the number of states goes to, you know,\nbecomes large, the proportion of programs in the collection goes to 100%.\nSo the asymptotic density of the programs is one.

Then it's sort of\nintriguing to think that you can solve almost every instance of a halting problem. But then when they hear the proof, it's\ncompletely a letdown. Unfortunately, nobody likes the theorem after the proof.\nAnd so the proof is so simple, though. If you know how a Turing machine operates, there's this infinite\npaper tape on which the machine writes zeros and ones, and the head moves back and forth according to rigid instructions. And the instructions are\nall of the form, if the machine is in such and such a state and it's reading such and such symbol\non the tape, then it should write this symbol on the tape and it should change to this new state specified, and it should either move left or right\nas specified. So a program consists of instructions like that. If you look at,\nIf you look at a program, you know, one of the states is the halt state and that's when the program halts. But you can calculate how many programs\ndon't have any instruction that transitions to the halt state. You can easily calculate the proportion. And\nin the limit, it goes to 1 over E squared, 13 and a half percent. If you calculate the limit, the\nproportion of programs with end states that don't ever halt because they don't have any instruction saying halt.\nThose programs obviously never halt because they can't halt. They don't have any instruction that says halt.\n- So 13% of programs, you could say, - 13%, you can say they don't halt, because you just look at them and you can understand them.\n- There's no halt state. - There's no... They never change to the halt state, so they can't halt. - I mean, that nevertheless is beautiful to know.\n- So that's a kind of trivial reason for non-halting, you know. And when I first made that observation, I thought, \"Okay, this is the proof\nstrategy.\" Because we wanted... I wanted to say at first the goal was, look, that's a stupid reason for a program not to\nhalt. And I just want to pile up as many stupid reasons as I can think of... ...until it gets more than 50%, and then I can say most.\n- That was brilliant. - Yeah. That was my goal. - I love this. - Yeah. So we thought more about it, though, and we hit the jackpot because we found one gigantic stupid reason that\nconverged to 100%. I mean, in the limit. And so, the stupid reason for a\nprogram not to halt is that, well, if you think about the behavior, see, the head is sitting there. It's on the leftmost cell of the\ntape at the very beginning. It's in the start state, and the head is following an instruction. And the instruction says,\n\"When you're in the start state,\" which it is, \"and you're reading something on the tape, then you should write something and you should change to a new state, and you should either move\nleft or right.\" But half of them move left.\nBut if you move left and you",

Okay, but that's half of them already just like that. Okay, and then some of them went right, and they changed to a new\nstate. And amongst those, you know, the new state, half of those ones are going left and half are going right from that place, and then most of those are\nchanging to a new state. When there's a lot of states, it's very likely that the next state that you transition to is new. And so you get this\nrandom walk behavior, if you know what that means, where half go left and half go right at each step. And there's a theorem due to Pólya which is\ncalled the Pólya recurrence theorem, which says when you have a random walk, a one-dimensional random walk, then it's very\nlikely to come back to where you started. And when that happens for us, then half of them from that place fall off on the next step.\nAnd so you can show using this kind of analysis that the probability one behavior of a random Turing machine is\nthat the head falls off the tape before it repeats a state. And that is the stupid proof that\nshows how to solve the halting problem. Because when that happens, we can answer the halting problem saying, \"No, the computation stopped because the machine crashed, not because\nit halted, so therefore it doesn't count as halting on some accounts.\" Or, you know, if you want to define that as halting, crashing as halting,\nthen...

And is there any chance the weird counterintuitive\nthing might be true that P equals NP? - Yeah, that's an interesting question. Sometimes people ask about whether it could be\nindependent, which I think is... ...An interesting question for logicians.\nAnd of course, well, one has to say if you're entertaining the idea of independence, you know, over which theory? Because\nevery statement is going to be independent over an extremely weak theory. So that's, you know, it doesn't make sense to say it's independent all by\nitself. You're only independent relative to a theory, right? So the way I think about P-NP is that... I mean, of course it's a theoretical question about\nthe asymptotic behavior of these problems. I mean, for a problem to be in P means that there, you know, there is a computable\ndecision procedure that runs in time bounded by some polynomial. But the coefficients on that polynomial could be\nenormous, and the degree could be incredibly high. And so for small values of\ninputs, then it doesn't make sense to talk about this polynomial time feasibility with respect to, say, the range of problem inputs that we will\never give it in our lifetime or in the span of human civilization or whatever. I mean, because it's an\nasymptotic property, it's really in the limit as the size of the inputs goes to infinity, that's the only time that polynomial\nor NP becomes relevant. And so maybe it's important to keep that in mind when. Sometimes you find\nkind of overblown remarks made about, you know, if P equals NP, then this will be incredibly important for human civilization\nbecause it means that we'll have feasible algorithms for solving these incredibly important- ... problems in NP. You know, that it would\ncause immense wealth for human societies and so on because we would be able to solve these otherwise intractable problems, and\nthat would be the basis of new technology and industry and so forth. I mean, people make these kind of remarks, but-\n- Of course - ... you have to temper those remarks by the realization that P and P equal NP or P not equal NP are\nnot about these practical things at all because of the asymptotic nature of the question itself.\nOkay, that's on the one hand. But on the second hand, we already have the algorithm, so we could use it already, except it's a terrible algorithm because\nit involves all this i",

We mentioned Gödel, Turing, if you throw him into the bucket.\n- So this is, I think, an incredibly difficult question to answer. Personally, I don't really think this way\nabout ranking the mathematicians by greatness.\n- So you don't have, like... You know, some people have a Taylor Swift poster in their dorm room.

Because I see that sometimes when mathematicians...\nThis also applies in physics and science, where completely separately, discoveries are made... ...Maybe at a very similar time.

I mean, I think it's certain ideas are in the air and being thought about but not fully articulated, and so\nthis is the nature of growth in knowledge. - Do you understand where ideas come from? - Not really.\n- I mean, what's your own process when you're thinking through a problem? - Yeah, that's another difficult question.

And actually, so the question of whether it's a new result\nor not is somehow less important to me. And so that has to do with this question of the greats and so on, whoever does it first. Because I think, for example, if\nyou prove a new result with a bad argument or complicated argument,\nthat's great because you proved something new. But I still want to see the beautiful simple because that's what I can understand. Also,\nI mean, I'm kind of naturally skeptical about any complicated argument because it might be wrong. And-\n...if I can't really understand it fully, like every single step all at once in my head, then I'm just worried maybe it's\nwrong. And so these different styles, sometimes mathematicians get involved with these enormous research projects that involve\nhuge numbers of working parts and- ...different technology coming together. I mean, mathematical technology, not physical\ntechnology. - And sometimes it actually involves now more and more something like the Lean programming language where some parts are automated, so you have this gigantic-\n- Yeah, yeah, I see. Well, that's another issue because maybe those things are, you know, less subject to skepticism when it's validated-\n...by Lean. But I'm thinking about the case where the arguments are just extremely complicated, and so I sort of worry whether\nit's right or not, whereas you know, I like the simple thing. And so, so I tend to have often worked on things that are\na little bit off the beaten path from what other people are working on from that point of view.\n- Your curiosity draws you towards simplicity. - Yeah. I wanna work on the things that I can understand and that are s-\nAnd luckily, I've found that I've been able to make contributions\nthat other people seem to like, you know, in this way, in this style. And so I've been kind of fortunate from that point of view.\nI mean, my process always, though, and I've recommended this always to my students,\nis just a kind of playful curiosity. So whenever I have... whenever there's an idea or a topic, then I just play around with it and\nchange little things or understand a basic case and then make it more complicated or press things a little bit on this\nside or apply the idea to my favorite example, you know, that's relevant or,\nand see what happens, or you just play around with ideas, and this often leads to insights that then lead to\nmore methods or more, you know, then pretty soon you're making progress on the problem. And so this is basically my\nmethod, is I just, you know, fool around with the ideas until I can see a path through towards something interesting.\nAnd then prove that, and that's worked extremely well for me. So I'm pretty pleased with that method.\n- You do like thought experiments where you anthropomorphize, like you mentioned? - Yeah, yeah. So this is a basic tool. I mean, I use this all the time.",

And because you're, especially if you do stick to a single\nproblem, especially if that problem has broken many brilliant mathematicians in the past, that you're really putting all your chips\nin.

And my attitude is that, hey, it doesn't matter. Maybe they have a good math idea, and so I want to\ntalk to them and interact with them. And so I think the Perelman case, you know, is maybe an instance where, you know, he's\nsuch a brilliant mind and he solved this extremely famous and difficult problem, and that is a huge achievement.\nBut he also had these views about, you know, prizes and somehow, I don't really fully understand why he would turn it down.\n- I do think I have a similar thing, just observing Olympic athletes that, in many cases, don't get paid very much,\nand they nevertheless dedicate their entire lives for the pursuit... ...of the gold medal. I think his case is a reminder that some of the greatest\nmathematicians, some of the greatest scientists and human beings do the thing they do, take on these problems for the love\nof it, not for the prizes or the money or any of that.

And so, of course, we should use MathOverflow score. ...Because -\n- That you're definitively. I mean, nobody's objectively the greatest mathematician of all time. - Yes, that's true.

And I, um- - asked him what his MathOverflow...\n- I wanted to know, first of all, what is his chess rating, and secondly, what is his MathOverflow score?\n- Oh, man. Well, that's the only way to judge a person, I think. That's, I think, objectively correct. Yeah.\nI mean, since you bring up chess, I've got to ask you about infinite chess. I can't let you go. You've, I mean, you worked on a million things, but infinite chess is one of\nInfinite chess\nthem. Somebody asked on MathOverflow, the mathematical definition of chess. - Right.\n- So can we talk about the math of chess and the math of infinite chess? What is infinite chess? - Oh, yeah, absolutely. Infinite chess is fantastic. Chess ordinarily is\nplayed on this tiny, tiny board. It's an eight by eight board, right? So when you play chess, normally it's on the eight by eight board. But we want to play\ninfinite chess, so on the, on the integer board. It's infinite in all four directions, you\nknow, but it still has the chessboard pattern, and maybe there's pieces on this board, maybe infinitely many pieces we allow. But one difference from\nfinite ordinary chess, in infinite chess, we don't play from a standard starting\nposition. Rather, you... The interesting situation is that you present a position where there's a lot of\npieces already on the board in a complicated way, and you say, \"What would it be like to start from this position or from that one?\" You know, and we want to\nproduce positions that have interesting features, meaning mathematically interesting features. And so I can tell you for\nexample, probably a lot of people are familiar with, say, the\nmate in two genre of chess problem. You know, you have a chess problem and it's white to mate in two, which means that\nwhite is going to make two moves, but the second move is going to be a checkmate. Or maybe mate in three or mate in five or whatever. We can have mate in\nN positions for any N. I mean, in infi",

    "text": "nite chess, you can create a position\nwhich is not mate in N for any N, but\nwhite has a winning strategy that will win infinitely many moves. So in other words,\nlet me say it again. There are positions in infinite chess that white can definitely win. Infinitely many moves, white is\ngoing to make checkmate. But there's no particular N for which white can guarantee to win in N moves.\n- There's no N? - No N. So it's not mate in N for any N, but it's a white win, infinitely many. The way to think about it is,\nwhite is going to win, but black controls how long it takes. - Ah, got it.\n- But it's doomed. Black can say, \"Well, I know you're gonna win, but this time it's gonna... you're gonna take a thousand moves at least.\"\nOr maybe in a different way of playing, black can say, \"Well, I know you're gonna win, but this time you're gonna have to take a million moves.\" For any number, black can say that. So it's\nthese really interesting positions. There's a position in my first infinite chess paper. So it's black to play in this position, and\nif black doesn't move that rook there, then white is gonna checkmate pretty quickly.\n- By the way, can we describe the rules of infinite chess? - Right. So the rules of infinite chess are there's just the ordinary pieces,\nand they move on this infinite board, which is just a chessboard, but extended in all directions- infinitely, with no edge. So there's no boundary.\nBut the pieces move just like you'd expect. So the knights move just the same and the rooks move, you know, on the ranks and files, and the bishops move on the same color\ndiagonals and, just like you would expect, except they can move as far as they want, you know, if there's no intervening piece in the way.\nThe one thing is that, okay, so the white pawns always move upwards and the black pawns always move downwards, but when they're\ncapturing, the pawns, you know, capture on the diagonal. So I think the piece movement is pretty clear. There's a couple\nof differences that you have to pay attention to from ordinary chess. For example, there's this threefold repetition\nrule in ordinary chess, but we just get rid of this for infinite chess because, of course, threefold repetition is just a proxy for infinite\nplay. The real rule is infinite play is a draw, not threefold repetition is a draw. That's just a kind of convenient\napproximation to the, what I view as the actual rule, which is that infinite play is a draw. So the only way to win is to make checkmate on\nthe board at a finite stage of play. And if you play infinitely, you haven't done that, and so it's a draw.\n- And the pawns can't be converted into- - And there's no promotion 'cause there's no edge. Right, exactly. And\nthis position that we were just talking about is a position with game value omega, which means that because it has an ordinal value, white is\ngoing to win, but black can play as though counting down from omega. What is the nature of counting down from\nomega? If you're black and you need ",

So the nature of counting down from omega is that you take this giant step on the first count,\nand then after that, you subtract one each time. You can't subtract one from omega because that's not an ordinal. So if you count down from omega, you have\nto go to some finite number, and then if you just subtract one each time, then that's how many more moves you get.\nSo that's the sense in which black can make it take as long as he wants because he can pick his initial number to be whatever he wants.\n- By the way, I just noticed that you were citing a MathOverflow question, which is really cool. - That's right, yeah. My interest in infinite chess was born on MathOverflow 'cause someone asked\nthis question. - Noam Elkies asked this question. That's so cool to see a MathOverflow citation\nin an arXiv paper. That's cool. How do you construct the position-\n- Right - the position that satisfies this? Is there an algorithm for construction? - No. This is an act of mathematical creativity, really, to come up\nwith... I had a co-author, my co-author, Corey Evans. He's a US national master chess player.\nA very strong chess player. He's also a philosophy professor of law.\n- Your collaborations are wonderful. That's great. - So I met him because he was a grad student at CUNY where I was at the time in New York.\nAnd also he was my son's chess coach for when my son was playing chess competitively in elementary school.\nThen Corey was the coach. And so we knew him that way. And that was right around the time when I was getting interested in\ninfinite chess, and I knew I needed a chess-knowledgeable partner. And\nso Corey was invaluable for the paper because\nthe proofs in infinite chess are extremely finicky because you create these positions,\nbut the details of the argument have to do with kind of chess reasoning, you know? My chess reasoning\nwasn't quite up to it because I would create the positions. Almost all the positions are ones that I made,\nbut this is like after many generations, of being corrected by Corey because Corey would come and say, \"Hey, you know, this pawn\nis hanging, and it breaks your argument, and\" \"or, or, you know, this bishop can leak out\" \"of the cage,\" or whatever. And so...\nthe process was I knew kind of in terms of these ordinals what we needed to create with\nthe position, and I would struggle to do it and create something that sort of had the features that I wanted, and then I would show it to Corey and he would say,\n\"Look, it doesn't work because of this and that,\" and so on. And so this kind of back and forth was extremely helpful to me, and eventually we, you know, converged\non arguments that were correct. So it's... yeah, it's quite interesting. Also, maybe\nanother thing to say is the follow-up paper to this one was a three-way paper with also Corey and myself and my\nPhD student, N",

Do you see AI as a potential great collaborator to you as a\nmathematician, and what do you think the future role of those- kinds of AI systems is? - I guess I would draw a distinction between what we have currently\nand what might come in future years.

And, you know, I've used various systems and so on, the paid models and so on. My typical experience is interacting with AI on a\nmathematical question is that it gives me garbage answers that are not mathematically correct.\nAnd so I find that not helpful and also frustrating.\nLike, if I was interacting with a person, the frustrating thing is when you have to argue about whether or not, you know, the\nargument that they gave you is right, and you point out exactly the error, in the AI saying, \"Oh, it's totally fine.\" And,\nyou know, if I were having such an experience with a person, I would simply refuse to talk to that person again.\nBut okay, one has to overlook these kind of flaws.

And so I was producing these beautifully typeset, you know,\nproblem sets, solutions, and so on. And I would print it up and submit it and so on, and the grades would come back,\nterrible grades.

And so I had somehow, you know, lost my-\n... because it was so beautiful, and I'm used to only seeing that kind of type setting when an argument was, you know, totally right-\n...

    "text": "ething that's not grounded in\nmathematical understanding, but rather something that is trying to look like something that is grounded\nin mathematical understanding. And those are not the same thing at all. And furthermore, I really wonder if one can make a kind of system for\nproducing genuine mathematical insight that isn't based in what I would view as\nmathematical understanding as opposed to the text generation systems. The methods that are used, you know, they\ndon't seem close enough grounded in understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts, but rather grounded in\nthe way words appear on a page in arguments about those concepts, which are not the same.\n- So there's a couple of things to say there. So one, I think there is a real skill in\nproviding the LLM system with enough information to be a good collaborator.\nBecause you really are dealing with a different... It's not a human being. You really have to load in everything you possibly can from your body of\nwork, from the way you're thinking, and that's a real skill. And then the other thing is, you know, for me, if it's at all anything\nlike programming, because I have a lot of colleagues and friends who are programmers who kind of feel similarly to you. And for me, I've\ngotten better and better and better at giving as much information as possible to the systems in a really structured way, maybe\nbecause I just like natural language as a way to express my thinking. And then the benefit comes from the\ninspiration that the system can provide by its ability to\nknow a lot of things and make connections between disparate fields and between disparate concepts. And in that way, it provides\nnot the answer but the inspiration, the handholding, the camaraderie that helps me get to the\nanswer, because it does know a lot more than me. Know, like knowledge. And if you\ngive it a lot of information and ask the broader questions, it can make some really\nbeautiful connections. But I do find that I have to be extremely patient, like you said.\nThe, the amount of times I'll do something dumb where I feel like, \"Uh, you don't get this at all, do you?\" That's a source of a lot\nof frustration for us humans. Like, \"This... Wait, this thing doesn't understand at all.\" If you can have the patience to look past\nthat, there might be some brilliant little insights that it can provide.\n- Right. - At least for me in the realm of programming. I should say programming, there's just so much training data. There's so much\nthere. And at least I see the light at the end of the tunnel of promising possibilities\nof it being a good collaborator, versus like something that gives you really true genius-level insights.\n- Right. It's probably true. Uh, I also find it likely that a lot of the... As far as mathematical training data is concerned,\nI just have to assume that math overflow answers are part of the training data. - Yes, of course. - It's so...\n- And you're... - So- - I mean, you're talking to yourself, essentially. - Ye",

    "text": "ah, maybe.\n- Sorry for the ridiculously big question, but what idea in mathematics\nMost beautiful idea in mathematics\nis most beautiful to you? We've talked about so many. - The most beautiful idea in mathematics is the\ntransfinite ordinals. These were the number system invented by Georg Cantor about counting beyond\ninfinity, just the idea of counting beyond infinity. I mean, you count through the ordinary numbers, the natural numbers: zero, one, two,\nthree, and so on. And then you're not done because after that comes omega, and then\nomega plus one, and omega plus two, and so on. And you can always add one. And so of course after you count through\nall those numbers of the form omega plus N, then you get to omega plus omega, the first number after all those. And\nthen comes omega plus omega plus one, and so on. You can always add one. And so you can just keep counting through the ordinals. It never\nends. Eventually, you get to omega times three, omega times four, and so on. And then the limit of those numbers, the first number that\ncomes after all those numbers will be omega squared. And this one is the first compound limit ordinal\nbecause it's a limit ordinal, is one of these numbers, an ordinal that doesn't have an immediate predecessor like omega and\nomega times two, omega times three. Those are all limit ordinals. But omega squared is a limit ordinal, but it's also a\nlimit of limit ordinals because the omega times three, omega times four, and so on, those are all limit ordinals that limit up to omega\nsquared. And then, of course, you form omega squared plus one, and then omega squared plus two, and so on, and it never stops. And it's\njust absolutely beautiful and amazing, and furthermore, forms the foundation for these\ntransfinite recursive constructions that came later. I mean starting with the Cantor-Bendixson theorem that I mentioned. And continuing with,\nthe construction of the V hierarchy and Gödel's constructible universe is built this way,\nand Zermelo's proof of the well-order principle using the axiom of choice is a transfinite recursive construction. And,\nand so the idea of just counting past infinity is so simple and elegant, and has led to so much fascinating mathematics.\n- Yeah, the infinity's not the end. And what about philosophy? What to you is the most beautiful idea in philosophy?\n- So I have a foot in both fields: philosophy and mathematics, and\nin some contexts I seem to be required to choose whether I'm a mathematician or a\nphilosopher. I mean, my training is in mathematics. My PhD, all my degrees are mathematics. But somehow I turned myself into a philosopher over\nthe years because my mathematical work was engaging with these philosophical issues. And so when I went... In New\nYork, I had appointments first in mathematics only, but then eventually I was also joining the philosophy faculty at the graduate\ncenter. And when I went to Oxford for the first time, my main appointment was in philosophy, and that's also true now\nat N",

    "text": "otre Dame although I'm also a concurrent professor in mathematics. And I have math PhD students still and philosophy PhD students. And so\nI don't really care to decide whether I'm a mathematician or a philosopher.\nAnd my work is engaging with mathematics and with philosophical issues in mathematics and with plain\nphilosophy, and there's this ample region between these re- between these two subjects. So it's not necessary to\nchoose. I remember when I first went to Oxford and I told my daughter that I was going to become professor of philosophy in Oxford,\nAnd she looked at me plaintively and said, \"Uh, but, but Papa, you're not a philosopher. Because in her\nmind, you know, her father was the mathematician and her mother was the philosopher 'cause my wife, Barbara, is a\nphilosopher. Now also at Notre Dame. We're together there. And okay, but\nfortunately, I don't really have to choose between them. So you ask about the most beautiful idea in philosophy, and I would have to say\nthat I think it's the distinction between truth and proof, the one that we discussed\nalready. Um, it's, it's so profound and\ngets at the heart of so many philosophical issues. I mean, of course this is a distinction that's maybe born in mathematics\nor mathematical logic, but that's already philosophical to a degree, and it's ph- you know, fundamentally a philosophical distinction. The\ntruth is about the, nature of the world and the way things are. It's about objective\nreality in a sense. Whereas proof is about our understanding of the world and about how we come\nto know the things that we know about the world. And so to focus on proof is to focus on the interaction that we have with\nthe objective reality. And, okay, I'm talking about the reality of mathematics, not the physical world, because, as I said, I live in the Platonic realm\nand I interact with mathematical reality, and so proof is about the interaction and how we come to know the\nfacts that are true in this mathematical reality, whereas truth is about what's really the case,\nsort of apart from our knowledge of it. And this is, I think, such a\ncore way that I have of understanding the world and the nature of logic and reasonings.\n- And the gap between the two is full of fascinating mysteries, both in the Platonic realm, but also in the\nphysics realm, and I would even say in the human psychology, sociology, politics, geopolitics, all of\nit, if you think about proof more generally, which is the process of discovery versus the truth itself. And that's our journey whatever\nfield we're in. Well, I for one, am grateful for\nhow marvelous of a philosopher, mathematician, and human being you are. It's truly an honor to speak with you today.\n- Well, thank you so much. It's such a pleasure to be here, and thank you for inviting me. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Joel David Hamkins.\nTo support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description where you can also find links to contact me, ask questions,",

I think there's a strong case to be made that it's the greatest game of all time.\nWhat are the elements that make that game truly great, do you think?\n- People searching for meaning amongst the violence. I think that the West and all the themes around the West really lend itself to that.\nAnd the gunplay was fantastic, and the horses were incredible. I think we got to spend, a smaller group of us, working on it from day one,\ncoming up with some weird, wacky ideas that we got to embed in the game. It was helpful that we got to be very\ncreative before it had a full team on it. - You lock yourself in a room and get anchovies and onion pizza and crushed...\nDiet Cokes? - Yes. - Is this accurate information? - Very accurate. - Why do you think there was so much excitement about GTA IV, GTA V, and now GTA VI?\n- I think we did a really good job of constantly innovating. The games always felt different. People have very strong feelings: \"I like this one.\"\n\"I didn't like that one as much,\" because they are pretty different. So you know what's going to happen. It's a Grand Theft Auto, you know it's going to be\na game about being a criminal, but the way it's going to be a game is going to change quite a lot. - The number one question from the internet, it is so ridiculous, but I must\nask, \"Have you seen Gavin?\" The following is a conversation with Dan Houser, a\nIntroduction\nlegendary video game creator, co-founder of Rockstar Games, and the creative force behind Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption\nseries, which includes some of the best-selling games of all time and some of the greatest games of all time.\nBoth Red Dead Redemption 1 and 2 have some of the deepest, most complex, and heart-wrenching characters and\nstorylines ever created in video games. Dan has started a new company, Absurdventures,\ngreat name, that is creating some incredible new worlds in multiple forms, including books, comic books, audio series, and\nyes, video games. That includes A Better Paradise, which is a dystopian near-future world with a\nsuper intelligent AI, American Caper, which is an insanely chaotic, violent, dark, satirical\nworld, and Absurdiverse, which is a comedic action-adventure world. I'm excited to explore all three of these. I have spent\nhundreds of hours in worlds that Dan has helped create, so this conversation was an incredible honor for me. And on top of\nthat, Dan and I talked a lot after and in the days since, and he has been just a wonderful human being.\nI'm just at a loss of words. I feel like the luckiest kid in the world.

    "text": "rlds in video game history. But when you grew up in\nthe late '70s and '80s, open-world video games wasn't a thing. So you've credited literature and film\nas early inspiration. So let's talk about film first, if we can. - Sure.\n- What to you are some of the candidates for the greatest films of all time, maybe films that were highly influential on you? I mean, Godfather.\n- God, well, I think for me, probably Godfather II more than Godfather I, but I love both of them. But I love the divided story in\nGodfather II. And as a migrant, I used to live in Soho. I love the bits in Little Italy, and I love\nthe sections in Sicily. I think and the bit, Ellis Island is just one of the best shots in all of cinema.\nWhen you see little Vito turning up in Ellis Island and you get that shot, it's amazing. It gives you a really good cinematic sense of what it must have been\nlike to arrive in America. - How much of the greatness of Godfather do you think is the writing? How much is the cinematography and how much is the acting?\nYou got De Niro, you got young Pacino. - Coppola started as a screenwriter, so I think he wrote, at least co-wrote\nthe script. So it's almost like the writing, directing almost become the same thing. But it's one of those films, both of them are those films, which I was thinking about\nthis idea of a perfect film where everything's good. Where the acting's seminal, where the writing's seminal, where the music is\nseminal, where the shots are so memorable, where the scenes you know, define what you think about things. It's impossible to think about the\nmafia and not think about The Godfather. - What about the pacing? It is a bit slow. You have movies like 2001\nSpace Odyssey, slow. - Yes. - It used to be, back in my day, it used to be slow.\n- Life got faster. Life just got, you know, as I think as we moved from the '70s into\nthe '80s, into the '90s, people had seen so many films, they just started to edit films faster. And people understood cinematic\nstorytelling so much that you could do things much quicker, you could show a look and just that meant you realized that person was\ngonna betray the other person. They just edited films much quicker. But I quite like the slowness. I think these days with modern, you know,\nhigh quality televisions, you don't have to necessarily watch these films in one sitting, particularly when you're rewatching them. So it doesn't bother me that they're long and slow.\n- Speaking of faster, life getting faster, I... I'm sure another influential movie was Goodfellas, Scorsese. That's faster, right?\n- Yes. - A mixture of crime and humor. - And almost like an open world game in some ways, in that it's this slice of\nlife. You know, I think that probably changed cinema at the tail end of the '80s, changed cinema at the sort of tail end of the '80s,\nearly '90s, more than any other film. And it's so iconic. In some ways I prefer Casino, but the invention\nis really in Goodfellas. I love the end of Casino, you know, the use of ",

The Sopranos is obviously completely inspired by Goodfellas.\n- Casino has, first of all, the character of Sharon Stone. I mean, everything. - The look, the clothes... ...The music.\n- I would say one of the most memorable moments in film for me is the meeting in the desert. I mean, just the drama building up to that between...\n- Dig another hole. - Yeah. The environment, the city, speaking of open world and creating a character from the city. It's one of the great Vegas films.\n- I think the great Vegas film. There are bits that I always... that I love. At the end, when everything's wrapping up, and on the one hand you\nsee the Robert De Niro character, he's still good at making money, so they let him return to normal life. But then you get that brilliant scene when all of the,\nthe mob bosses from back home, they're discussing all these people who may or may not be able to implicate them. And then there's\nthat incredibly cold line where one of them, they're thinking about the old, you know, I think it's the casino manager, and one of them just goes, \"Ah, the way I see it, why take a\nchance?\" And then the next thing, he's just shot. The brutality of it all is just brilliant.\n- I don't know, I probably have to disagree with you on Vegas. There's at least some competitors. You got what, Nicolas Cage Leaving Las Vegas? I mean, falling in love with a\nprostitute. You've written some of the great crime stories ever. - Thank you.\n- And in some sense, there's love stories in there. And you've talked about-\n...being a bit of a romantic yourself. Appreciating the depth of love stories in literature at the\nvery least. And there is a dark kind of love story between an alcoholic and a prostitute. He got an Oscar for that.\n- I think he did for that, didn't he? - Plus there's the caricature of the drug world of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. That's an interesting one.\n- I love the book so much. I was obsessed by it when I was about 17, 18. And I enjoyed the film, but I preferred the book.\n- Has a Hunter S. Thompson type of character ever made it into any of your stories? - No, but one of the things we're working on now, there's sort of\nan English version of Hunter S. Thompson if he was also a market gardener. I love that persona. But he's kind\nof... it's hard. If you make him American, it's hard for it not just to be Hunter S. Thompson. - Is this an American caper?\n- No, it's in this animated show we're developing in this sort of comedy world we're working on called Absurdiverse, and it's in one of the stories in\nthat. - What is Absurdiverse? - Absurdiverse is a comedy\nuniverse we're developing that will be an open-world video game and then some loosely adjacent stories that we're going to\nmake as animated TV shows or possibly animated movies. We're still thinking that all through. And we're building the game up in San\nRafael at the moment, and it's early days",

And it's trying to be... like, trying to make a game that feels a\na little bit like a living sitcom. - Is there some drama and tragedy at the edges, or is it pure comedy?\n- I hope it's got comedy, cynicism, heart, drama, and some amusing life lessons.\nOtherwise, you can't just have jokes for 40 hours, it won't work. - Okay, so comedy needs some darkness.\n- Well, I think it needs story. One of my favorite comedies of this century is The Office because it was incredibly funny, but also because it had narrative\nand heart underneath the cynicism. I think with narrative, you get a drive alongside jokes.\n- And there's going to be an open-world video game. - Yes. Yes. - When? - Two, three, four years. Still thinking that through.\n- So, what's the process of getting from the idea to the end of a video game? Why does it take so long to get it right?\n- That's an interesting question. I think if you look at the scale at which they're built, you could argue it the other way, why is it so quick? I mean, you really are\nbuilding, in one go, a world, a city, and 40 hours of entertainment cut through it.\nand 40 hours of entertainment cut through it. You know, these things are massive four-dimensional mosaics that are intensely complicated and have to work\nin lots of different ways. And I think that's us being kind of aggressive on the timeline. - We're taking a tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent,\nbut I have to return to some films. Let me just list a few of my favorites. So first of all, you said you love great war books.\n- Yes. - and movies. - Yes. - So we have to throw in Platoon from Oliver Stone and Apocalypse Now, for me at least.\n- Of course. - There's more crime, fast-moving crime movies,\nlike Scarface. I also love True Romance. - I love True Romance. Possibly the best, one of the best scripts ever written.\n- Written, of course, by Quentin Tarantino. What do you love about True Romance? I think sometimes, depending on the\nday, depending on the bar and how much alcohol I've had, I will say True Romance is the best movie ever made.\n- Yeah, I mean, True Romance is super fun. Tony Scott was a really good director, so it moves at a really good speed. It's funny, it's completely unbelievable,\nbut you really care about the characters. It's the kind of, you know, this world that obviously doesn't exist, but you feel it does exist. The characters\nare larger than life. The dialogue is unbelievable. You could just sit and watch unbelievable. You could just sit and watch them talk all day long. And, you know,\nyou just... it's amusing. You just want to live in that world. I was thinking about, like, what do you like about films? It's the idea to be in a world. You want\nto... they're not real. They're never real, but you want to be in these fake worlds that people have invented. - And I think you said that what makes a great world is having a large cast of\ncharacters.

It's kind of like a mini\nGTA type game. Some of the same beauty, the comedy, the love, the- - Yeah, and it's all crossed with Play It Again, Sam. It sort of feels a bit like\nthat with the Elvis character. - What about greatest war film? What would it be for you? - Greatest war film? If I'm feeling serious, it would be\na Russian film called Come and See. which is probably the most intense film ever made. And if I'm\nfeeling slightly less serious, Apocalypse Now, and I would always want to watch the original cut. I don't prefer the re-edits. I like the\noriginal first release. I think it's tighter and slicker and works the best. - Yeah, of course, Apocalypse Now is this hallucinatory journey into darkness,\nI think, madness. - Yeah, but from your first- - Yeah - scene onwards, it's just got these amazing set piece after set piece\nand, again, incredible characters, brilliant dialogue. - Some of the greatest films about war reveal that war is not what it seems,\nand there's different ways of doing that. And you've talked about different books. The Thin Red Line is another book— ...and movie that shows that.\n- Yeah, yeah, and I watched the movie years before I read the book, and I didn't understand the movie.\nAnd then I read the book, and I read a lot about the editing of the movie, and I understood why I didn't understand the movie,\nand that's 'cause the movie makes no sense. It is beautifully shot, and the music is one of the best film scores of all time. But they edited two different\nbattle scenes into one battle in a way that they're spread apart by ages in the book to assemble... I think they filmed the book pretty much verbatim. It would've been as a\nsix-hour movie, then edited this impressionistic thing that's incredibly beautiful but doesn't necessarily make narrative sense at the end of it.\nBut it's still very beautiful, the film. - And in terms of Westerns, what's the greatest? The Good, the Bad and the\nUgly, Unforgiven? Those are for me, maybe even Django Unchained. You've mentioned Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\n- I think for me it's two films from, I think, pretty much the same year, Butch Cassidy and The Wild Bunch.\n- I love Robert Redford. Rest in peace. - That film, it's just impossible to imagine any buddy film without Butch Cassidy.\n- It's Paul Newman, Robert Redford, and Clint Eastwood for you, also? Has that impacted your writing on Red Dead?\n- I love Unforgiven, but the truth is with Red Dead, I'd seen a lot of Western",

And then,\nyou know, then I had to start thinking about writing one for work. And I deliberately did not binge on Westerns. I tried to watch no more Westerns\nand just think about what I liked about them, what I didn't like about them, what would be a take that would work today and would\nwork within the confines of a game. And I think Red Dead 1 was a slightly more traditional Western. And then having done that,\ntried to take Red Dead 2 in a different direction so that it felt like a worthy successor. Didn't\njust feel like more of the same. - From movies to video games, when did you first fall in love with video games? Literature was the first love.\nMaking video games\n- No, films. - Films. - Films was always, well, what I loved first as a kid was films. Um,\nolder... Began reading books properly aged about eight. Was watching films long before that.\n- Nice. - And then probably it was always bouncing between the two, which I preferred. I think they're good at different things. Games,\nI played and, above all, watched a lot of games as a kid, as being a young kid, you know, other people playing them. Um, and I obviously liked\nthe core thing games do, which is you press a button and something happens. They're responsive, they're alive, and that's\ncaptivating. And then the competitive angle of games is fun, or you know, beating this, beating that, winning this. That was fun as well.\nSometimes obsessively so. You know, I remember being completely addicted at one point when I should've been studying, for months at a time, to Tetris\non a Game Boy. You know, I liked games and I liked interactivity and I liked the movement to this digital world that's really emerged for\nme pretty much as soon as I left college. But I didn't love it.

So that was really the moment for\nme. - Yeah, of course, because you were a pioneer of open-world games that are so narrative-driven. So it's like you didn't have too many examples.\n- Yeah, before that it was PS1 or even before that. Games looked terrible. You know, you would be like\nit's eight pixels, it's a car.

There's the feeling like, first of all, you had a feeling you could do anything,\nand then the world was reacting to it. - Yes - in a way that didn't feel scripted.\n- Yes, and it wasn't scripted. It was really, really, really low-rent AI. It was a simulation that you could\nprod and push and see what happened, and I think that was incredibly... It was two things. It was the fact that\nhere was a simulation that you could mess about with and the simulation seemed to have a personality. So you could push and see...

I could just listen to the radio, I could...\nLook at billboards, I could talk to pedestrians, and not in GTA III, but by Vice City, you could begin rudimentary talking. And the world\nwas there and existing, and so it was the idea of almost something that really tried to explore in lots of games, the idea of being a digital\ntourist. You know, you were in, you were in these worlds, and you went there as a visitor, and they existed\nalmost independent of you. It felt like when you turned up, the world was running. It didn't feel like you'd started it. Of course, you had started it, but that feeling,\nI think, was one of the things, the illusions that people found very captivating, was, \"I'm in a world that both doesn't exist and does exist.\"\n- So there are these two concepts that I was reading about, just to put names on them: one is systemic video game design, so systemic\ngames, and the other is sandbox video games. And the systemic is from the environment perspective, which means that there are these\ninterlocking game rules and systems that interact with each other and produce emergent behavior.\nAnd that emergent behavior is what creates a feeling like there's a living world. And then the sandbox aspect, which is overlapping but different, is from\nthe user perspective, from the player perspective, the feeling like you can do anything. And when those two things combine, the feeling\nlike you can do anything, and the feeling like there's a world that's full, that is also doing anything",

And I think with GTA III,\nyou know, for me, it came at a really interesting time in my life personally, and I was very able to engage in it, probably for the first time professionally,\nactually away to do something. And we were really sort\nof scratching, began to scratch the surface on how do we fill these worlds with content, and how do we make that content interesting and make the content all\ninterwoven? So, as you start to mess with these systems, they also feel alive and interesting.\nOpen world video games\n- There's often been a tension through your work between an open world, that freedom, and the narrative...\n...driven storytelling. And I think you've often, maybe always, gotten the balance\nright. So what is the value of each, and how do you get the balance right?\n- Well, I think the open world is intrinsically pretty fun. It's just fun to be in a world and have complete freedom. And certainly, I think at various points,\nwe debated or, you know, I'd have theoretical discussions in my own head with myself, or other people in the team would really push\nfor less story, less story. You know, let the whole thing evolve organically. You know, have it all be procedural. Have it all just\nevolve from what you do. I think for me, I would always come back to going, \"Story can be, if done well, can be incredibly\ncompelling, and it gives you some structure.\" So, I think... and something to do, and it helps you from a game design\nperspective unlock the features. It means we know the features, the big features 'cause they, you know, essentially when you put someone in a\nworld and give them a whole new way of interacting with that world through the control panel, it can be a little overwhelming. You know, playing a game is a lot more of an\nengaging experience even than reading a movie, you know, reading a book or watching a movie. You've got to engage in it properly. So how you unlock the\nfeatures and how you unlock the world, there's an art and a skill to that. And I think we felt that a structured story was the\nbest way to do that and to have control over that process. And also just, you know,\npeople are looking in their lives for story. I think story's very important and very powerful, and when you combine the two successfully, you get the best of both\nworlds. But it is a... You know, there is a tension always there. I think in a game like GTA IV, which I worked on and loved and I thought the story\nwas great, but we got criticized because people felt there was almost too much story, and that meant you cared too much about Niko, and he wasn't as\neffective an avatar in the open world. I think we probably got closest to reconciling\nthem as perfectly as they can be done in Red Dead II, or when playing as Trevor in GTA V if you\nwanted to be crazy. I think those were ",

So you kind of\nwant a character that was rounded and you felt had good sides and bad sides. - But you felt that character's personality.\n- Yes. - You felt the depth. You've actually talked about this... the really powerful concept of creating a 360-degree character. I think somewhere\nCharacter creation\nyou mentioned that in order to do that, you had to be able to imagine what that character would do in any possible situation.\n... which is a really interesting philosophical concept. I started to immediately think of that, can I imagine...\nHow good of an NPC am I? Can I imagine myself in every possible I tried to do that very much when I,\nwhen I look at human history, when I look at the Roman Empire, when I look at World War II within the German side, the Russian side, the British\nside, the American side, just I imagine myself if I was a soldier. - But that exercise, like if you put Trevor as a\nsoldier in World War II, what would he do? - No, I mean, that may be going a little bit too far. But basically, what are the limits of the\nintegrity? What are the limits? of how romantic is he? How narcissistic? All those kinds of elements you have to\nthink about in order to create the full character. What does it take to create that kind of 360 character? How hard is it?\n- It was a lot of thinking. Sometimes a year from when we begin talking about\na project and dialing it. I would just get some initial ideas, like one sentence. They are\na Serbian immigrant, or they are a retired gunfighter with a wife\nin, you know, type. Very simple stuff. And then just start to think through it from every angle.\nAnd you know, start to think, \"Would it work if they acted like this? Would it work if you acted like that? If this is the world,\nhow does it contrast with the world?\" Because I always thought the games were a kind of mathematical equation. They were the personality of the\nworld, you know, multiplied or divided by the personality of the protagonist. And when that creates interesting friction, that's a\nreally fun experience for the player. It's almost always\nat least one or more of the protagonists, cause obviously in GTA5 we had more than one. We'd have someone\nwho'd moved to the place or was in a new part of the place, or moved to a new part of the map, cause it was really, as a player, I think it was really easy, much more easy, to identify\nwith your avatar when they, like you, were a fish out of water.

How much of a sociopath are they? And what are their good qualities? What is going to give them humanity alongside that? What are\nthey, what are they, what for them apart from money is worth dying for? And then you start to build it out from these fundamental\nsides.

He wants to fix humanity and\nit seems that the \"children,\" quote unquote, that it creates are the real monsters.

So he's, he can control people's minds arguably, but he can't control the world. And so he wants to be human, he wants to have these human\nexperiences.

Occasionally, he sulks and goes off and hides somewhere\nand stops paying attention. - Yeah, but there are some characters that really create a flavor of a world.\n- In his world, he was built as an AI agent for this digital, large-scale, massively multiplayer video game these\npeople were trying to build. And so he's almost like God in his world. He's not quite God, but he's got a lot of the qualities of God. So he has to deal with,\n\"Am I God? Am I human?

It's so counterintuitive, but the people that say,\n\"We're almost there, we just need to... There's this path we take and we'll be perfect then\"\nand that somehow gets us into trouble. It's so fascinating that we have to like the bad bits, we have to love the bad bits about humans. Those\nbugs are features. - Yeah, and there's bad bits and there's flaws. And I\nthink we're all flawed, and we can really try to be better people. But we\nstill have to accept that we're flawed and we're not perfect, and we have to accept that in other people. And I think when we do that, we're more human, and that's\nprobably usually the right course. - I mean, it really is a return to that\nSolzhenitsyn line of, \"The line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man.\" And he also, like, the full description of that is really powerful, which is\nthe line moves from day to day, from month to month throughout the life of the person as they understand better and better.\nAnd as the perspectives shift, as you evolve, as the world around you evolves, as you gain deeper and deeper understanding.\nAnd as the flaws in this combinatorial way affect your own understanding of your own flaws and self-reflection.

You know, what\nhappens when AI runs rampant in its own fake digital world? That was the... I felt that we had a hypothesis that\nwas worth exploring, and could give us some really interesting visuals and give us a really interesting story to tell.\n- And it would be incredible to create a sort of AI video game as the world is developing smarter and smarter AIs. It allows us\nas humans to play the game and to reflect on the thing that we humans are creating. It's a real commentary as the thing is happening.\nCan LLMs write video games?\nSo I have to ask, as a person who loves literature, and one of the, if not the greatest writer in video game history. Kurt,\nin the book- of Better Paradise, has this nice line that I think is thoughtful: \"At one point in college, I even wanted to be\na writer. How ridiculous is that? A writer. Language models ended that fantasy for me and millions of others. So instead,\nI decided to get a master's in marketing and started to sell language models.\" So you, as a writer and creator of some of the most legendary narratives,\n- Thank you - in recent history, how do you feel about LLMs being able to write in a way that looks awfully human?\n- I'm not that afraid of them for large-scale\nconcepts. I don't think they're going to be very good at that. I think if you were... I think it's harder if... I began and I was too shy to tell anyone\nI wanted to be a writer. That's why I ended up in video games. And I would scribble away, like writing manuals and writing\non like PS1 games, all 12 lines of dialogue in a game. Sometimes I wouldn't even get that job and I'd just write the website copy. And\nthen by working your little bits and pieces. And then, you know, I'd luckily done enough work that when GTA III turned up, it was\nthe first thing that resembled real writing. I had all of the small bits of skills that I could assemble into it. Based on my fairly limited\nunderstanding of how language models work, they're not going to replace good\nideas. They can't really come up with good new ideas. What they can do is do low-level stuff. So I think it's going to be harder for people to start out in\nsome of these spaces. If you're not a very good concept artist, you're in a lot of trouble. If you have original ideas, I think you're fine. But I think,\nI also think that they've done the first 90% of the work\nto sound human, 95% possibly in some areas.

But if you've got talent, I think it'll be fine. - Yeah, I agree with you totally, actually. And it's hard to really\nput a finger on it. So, one way to illustrate that, I speak English and Russian, and I'm reading Dostoevsky in\nboth languages and using LLMs to translate back and forth because I was preparing to have a conversation with the translators of Dostoevsky.\n- Which ones? - Uh, Richard Pevear and Larisa Volokhonsky. - Yeah. I read it when they first did Crime and Punishment. That was amazing.\n- They're wonderful translators, and a wonderful love story too. But in the translation process, you get to see the LLM is missing\nsome magic. And that couple of translators are world-class experts\nat capturing the magic. And I can't quite put that into words. Because you said, like, totally novel ideas, yes. But also this\nmagic of the timing, the right word at the right time, - Yeah. The phrasing. - captures the human experience. So they can do some really incredibly\nhuman-like, the 90%, like you mentioned, human-like phrasing about the bulk of the\nstorytelling.

But even the main script for the main mission was thousands of pages long.\n- What was the writing process like on that, to generate one page at a time? - Bit by bit, by bit, over several years.

And I remember being very scared because I thought it might be too much. It might feel over the top. I think, you know,\nthe game's so pretty. The artists are doing such an amazing job. The game's looking... I think we can get away with this. Let's try it. And then they\nmotion capture the animation.

He escaped the trauma of war\nto come to America to pursue the American dream, I suppose, which became for him this thing that drags him back into violence.\n- Yes, he can never escape his sort of violent past or... I don't know if he can never escape it. He never does escape it.\nYou know, whether he's got agency or not is a whole another question. Of course he doesn't, because he's a character in a video game.\nBut, you know, whether he ever could have escaped it another way, who knows? - I think he's probably the greatest character for me created in the\nGrand Theft Auto series. Of all the characters you've written in Grand Theft Auto, would Niko be the best character you created?\n- I think he's the most innovative.\nAnd the most morally defensible in some ways. You know, he does a lot of stuff where he's fighting for what's right.\nHe's the nicest person in some ways. Is he the best protagonist of a GTA game? I think he's the most innovative protagonist of a GTA game.\nStructurally, he might be too nice in some ways. He's also tough, like he just comes across as tough. I loved CJ in\nSan Andreas. I thought Melee did such... Just the way he spoke gave him such humanity. So I just loved... It wasn't the writing, it was the\nquality of the voice acting, it was just so strong for him. I think aspects of Michael, he was so understated, but he loved the\ncharacter, but he brought so much humanity to this character who's so flawed, who is such a... you know, he has no principles.\nHe sells everyone out. I think Ned Luke did such an amazing job and didn't necessarily get as many plaudits as Steven Ogg for Trevor, who was\nalso wonderful. But I think the Ned Luke character sort of anchors that game so much. So I like all of them in different ways, but I probably\nlove Niko the most. - And of course, Michael's from Grand Theft Auto V.\nAnd he's one of three protagonists with also Franklin and Trevor. And you said that of the things you're proud of creating and you\nthink was a great accomplishment, it was Red Dead Redemption 2, the ending of Red Dead Redemption 1,\nall of Grand Theft Auto IV, and the middle part of Grand Theft Auto V when the three characters come together. Can you speak to the Grand Theft Auto V?\nIs there some degree... I don't know if you're a Dostoevsky guy, but... - A little bit. - Is there some aspect of\nthe three protagonists, sort of, you know, Brothers Karamazov, ...Alyosha, Dmitry, and Ivan, sort of, using the protagonists to\nexplore the spectrum of human nature and... - Yes, sure. - ...just the tension between them that allows you the, the,\nthe three of them become a character in themselves. - Their relationship. - Their relationship. - is",

    "text": " more... Yeah, it was, it was, I think one of the reasons that,\nthat the team did such... That Grand Theft Auto is still so popular is we always tried as a group to really innovate from game to game within\nthe confines of what it was. It was a crime, it was a crime drama, you know, began as a crime, a crime sim in GTA 1 about stealing, you\nknow, 2D top-down cars. And we always tried to innovate with the narrative and innovate with the art direction, innovate with every piece of the game.\nAnd I think having done, you know, GTA IV, which was this kind of operatic journey for this big lead character, and then\nthese two extra stories that came afterwards. So the challenge, the, the, the challenge was, can we combine... Can we make a video\ngame which tends to be very much focused on one protagonist, but have multi-protagonists? And the technical\nchallenge of moving from character to character. The team did such an amazing job that I don't think people realized how hard it was.\nBut we would sit there just sort of holding our heads 'cause they hurt so much around like, what happens if you do this, then do that? It's just, this is so hard.\nWhy have we, why have we decided to do this? It's horrible. And then it all came together. But I think the idea was to develop\nthree characters who do feel like characters. They don't just feel like philosophical, you know, psychological avatars. But where\none is really, really driven by ego, one is really driven by id, and one is really driven by trying to get ahead. So some kind\nof representation of the super-ego and see how that feels when they all play off against each other.\nHard work and Rockstar's culture of excellence\n- One of the most upvoted questions on Reddit about GTA V, From a fan, \"GTA V is my favorite game ever made. I spent over\n1,000 hours in the world of GTA V and GTA Online. GTA IV is a hard second or third. It never ceases to impress me. When you\nlead a team of over 1,000 people to make a masterpiece like GTA V or Red Dead Redemption 2, how do you ensure that the bar of perfection is always\nmet? How's that even possible? We know the answer isn't money, because there's other studios with a lot of money, and they are two decades behind\nRockstar.\" So what does it take to create these worlds, to create these incredibly compelling games and stories? - I think the cult- I mean, certainly when I was at Rockstar, I was a\nworker amongst workers. You know, the culture was one of excellence and\ntried to provide creative clarity. And people would just, you know... And also an ambition to make... I think we were\nlike... We thought GTA III could be really popular. Really popular to us meant, quite honestly, it's gonna sell two or three million copies.\nAnd we thought we were making something pretty innovative. I mean, we knew we were making something innovative, but we didn't know if people would understand how innovative\nit was. And then when we got the chance to make Vice City, and to try and repeat it, I think",

And to use, this was long before we had lots of resources, to use time and whatever money we had to\nalways put impressive stuff on the screen, always think about what we can do to push the\nmedium of video games and the sort of medium of building fake worlds further.\nAnd that was always... You know, there was a, it was, you know, both clarity of, \"Here's what we're trying to do. Here's what the tone of the game is going to\nbe. Here's how features will fit into that, and why these features would work and these features wouldn't work.\" Because fundamentally by 2002, you\ncould put pretty much any feature into a game you wanted. It wasn't a question, it wasn't a technical limitation. It was just making it cohesive. And\nthen it was also just everyone committing to a culture of excellence. - Navid Khansari, an award-winning director and virtual reality game maker,\nwho worked with you on a number of Grand Theft Auto games, spoke highly about his time working with you. Quote, \"We always worked ourselves to\nthe bone, but it wasn't coming from the top down. Sam and Dan always rolled up their sleeves, and they were always there. They never left us\nholding the bag. We all thought we were making badass shit, so it didn't matter how hard we worked.\" So I'm sure there were some tough grinds.\n- I think finishing it is certainly... It's tough, but it also is intensely rewarding. And you get something done, and you've\nmade something. And that feeling is, as you say, really, really incredible. I mean, it can sometimes feel a bit empty as well because\nit's... when you're finished, you're like, \"Then my life's got nothing to it,\" and then you have to... You know, but that's the same with any big undertaking that you take. I don't think there are...\nYou know, when you're working that hard, you do not have a good work/life balance. But the truth is, you're not working that hard all of the time.\nSo you just have to manage it slightly differently. - Man, that's such such a heavy thing about the human experience. I've talked to Olympic gold medal winners,\nand many of them face real depression after they win the gold medal. because they've been pursuing\na thing that they deeply care about. This has been everything, and they're so truly happy to do it, and then it's like, \"What else\nis there in life?\" What, compared to this, what else is there? So that's\nthe ups and downs of life. You need the darkness and you need the lows to really experience the highs. Let me ask you\nGTA 6\nabout the pressure. There's an insane level of excitement and expectation for Grand Theft Auto VI.\nSame was true for GTA V and GTA IV, and even before that. And you and the team delivered every time. How difficult was it\nto do creative work under such pressure where everyone expects this to be a success?\n- I was pretty good at compartmentalizing, you know, and just saying...

And we, as a group, made something we are proud of.\nThen that's enough. You can't... If you don't want to go insane, or if I didn't want to go insane, I couldn't sit there and worry about financial\nresults. If we made something great and it didn't sell, that would have to be okay. Because the goal is to make something that's...\nYou know, video games are expensive, so it is a sort of commercial form of creativity. It's a commercial art form, you know. So\nyou have to be in your mind, you're spending large amounts of someone else's money. You have to try and make it back for them. But at the same time, my argument\nwith myself was, \"Well, if we... The way to make it back is try and make something great.\" So both pressures are pointing in the same direction.\nI think GTA IV was very pressured because there had been all this pressure on the company. The company nearly imploded several times\ndue to Hot Coffee. It was extremely tough. So I think that felt very stressful. GTA III, the company was basically broke.\nBut I was young and didn't really care. I wasn't living in the grown-up world yet. All of them had their own pressure. All of the games had their own\npressure. The more I felt I'd gone into it creatively and tried to be more ambitious, for me personally, I felt more\npressure, you know, when it came out, that would have been the right choice. Because again, if you're trying to take big swings\ncreatively and you've spent a lot of money, that can be quite stressful. I think with Red Dead 2, we were behind schedule. We\nwere over budget so much I didn't want to think about it. And you're making a game about a cowboy dying of TB, and the game's\nnot coming together. Turns out a lot of people doubt you at that moment, you know, it's not that fun. So I think that was a lot of pressure.\nBut, you know, anything, doing something new, you know, the new stuff, there's not necessarily pressure on releasing a comic book in the same way,\nbecause it's not taken as long, but, you know, if you're making things, there's always pressure that people are going to like it. - Why do you think there was so much excitement about GTA IV, GTA V, and now GTA VI?\n- Because they don't come out that regularly. And I think we did a really\ngood job of constantly innovating within what the IP was. The games always felt different, you know, people have very strong feelings: \"I like this one.\nI didn't like that one as much,\" because they are pretty different. So you would... there would be simultaneously where you know what's going to happen. It's a Grand Theft Auto, you know, it's going\nto be a game about being a criminal, but the way it's go",

We really tried to market them in a way that felt like\nan update of classic film marketing, where you really felt like you're already in the product just because you'd seen the trailers and stuff.\n- You've mentioned that you haven't written for Grand Theft Auto VI. What's it feel like Grand Theft Auto VI returning to Vice City? This is over 20\nyears later, but the original GTA Vice City game was set in the '80s.\nSo maybe inspired by Scarface a little bit? - Scarface, Miami Vice.\n- Miami Vice. - and our '80s childhoods. You know what I\nrealized quite a while ago, unfortunately, was that we made that game and it was set I think in '86. And it... We made it in\n2002, so 16 years after. And now it's way past 16 years since Vice City came out. So the '80s were not that long\nago when we made it. - You know, I think Miami is one of the most unique cities in the world.\nEspecially if you're thinking about satirizing American culture, it has this duality of a glossy surface and a dark underworld.\nIt has the influencers, the crypto bros, the yachts, bikinis, plastic surgery, sports cars, drugs, cartel cash, luxury, super rich\npeople, and the desperately poor, just the whole of it. Would it be like the perfect city to explore the full\ncast of characters that are possible, that human nature can generate?\n- I think it's one of them. You know, there's a reason why GTA kept coming back to Miami, New York, Los Angeles. I think they're\nall very good for exactly what you laid out. You know, you could move it to any of those and it would work, you know?\n- So yeah, there's a melting pot... - Melt... - ...aspect in New York also, right? - Yeah, a melting aspect to LA. You know, there's glitz, glamour, underbelly,\nimmigrants, you know, enormous wealth in all of them. I think those are what, I think, are really fun for any, not even just the GTA, but for anything where\nyou want a kind of slice of life, almost like a sort of psychotic version of a Dickens book. You know, this big slice of life. He did it with London.\nYou know, this psychotic version of these, you know, all kinds of characters in a melting pot. Any of these global cities work well for that.\n- Do you know if that was ever a consideration to go elsewhere, to like a London?\n- We made a little thing in London 26 years ago, GTA London, for the top-down for the PS1. That\nwas pretty cute and fun. As the first mission pack ever for PlayStation 1. I think for a full GTA game, we always decided there was so much Americana\ninherent in the IP, it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else. You know, you needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life\ncharacters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective.

And having to watch Grand Theft Auto VI be released? Or is it more excitement? What's the feeling?\n- I think it's a, it's... How would I describe it? Of course, it's all, all of the above, you know,\nit's exactly as you, you know, pleased to be doing other stuff, excited for what we're working on now, super\nexcited of course, letting go of something I worked on in one way or another for\nlike 20 odd years. You know, and wrote on them for the last 10 or 11 that came out. Wrote all of them, or you know,\nlead writer on all of them, whatever it was. So of course, letting go of that\nis, you know, is a big, is a big change. And a lot, and, and, and sad in a way, because each of the games was a kind of standalone story. It's\nnot quite the same as, as I think probably it would be in some ways sadder if someone continued on Red Dead, because it was a cohesive two-game\narc. That might be more sad to hear someone working on that. But again, not, and that, that will probably happen too. I don't own the IP. That was sort of part of\nthe, the deal. It's a privilege to work on stuff, but you don't necessarily own it. - When you're done with the game, does it always feel like a goodbye?\nLike when you're done with Red Dead 2, is it like you're saying goodbye to Arthur? The characters you created, you're walking away.\n- You kind of are saying goodbye to Arthur in the end of the game. - Yeah. - Even before the end of the game. Um,\nyeah, I think you've got, you know, I've been with them for seven, eight years, and you have to kind of let it go or you can't go on to the next one.\n- Yeah. - So, there's always this thing of, of, \"Okay, that's done.\" And sometimes people would ask me questions and I, about older games. And certainly when I was in the middle of making\nnew ones in the se- I just couldn't really necessarily even remember. And I got a pretty good memory normally, because you kind of have to let it go. So, it's not,\nit's, you're so immersed in it and thinking about it. And certainly in that last period, the last few months, you're really, really immersed in every little nuance\nand every little detail all of the time. And then you're just not thinking about it in the same way. - Yeah. It's funny from the player perspective,\nit feels like an old friend that I miss, whether it's John or Arthur or Nico, it's a real goodbye. That's the, there's a real sadness to finishing a\nvideo game. Like- - I hope so - ...legitimately- not just because the story is sad or-\n- Because you've been with them so long. - Yeah. And it's a real goodbye to close it. There's that feeling when you're sort of\nclosed the video game, and it's, I mean, it's like saying goodbye to a friend.

And more broadly, what\nwas your definition of success for a video game? - I would assume it will because it's so\nanticipated, and anticipation is the best driver of early sales, as we saw with GTA IV versus Red\nDead Redemption One.

So I think you had this combination of technical know-how, a very, very strong team, and really strong material.\nvery, very strong team, and really strong material. - Where did you have to go in your mind, maybe philosophically, maybe\nspiritually, to be able to create the RDR world? Of course, it was based on Red Dead Revolver, but that's—\n- Yes - —that's a fundamentally different. I mean, that leap into the great mythic story that was Red Dead Redemption one.\nAnd then even more so, Red Dead Redemption two. That was unlike anything\nyou, or maybe anyone, has ever created in video games. - Thank you.\n- So, like, what drugs were involved? - No drugs. - Okay. - No. Stopped the drugs long before.\n- Okay. - That's why I did all that work. Had nothing else to do. So yeah, open world video\ngames were very good for my mental health in that way. Kept me busy. But Red, so Red—\nDead, I'll tell, I'll give you my version. Now the games are made by big teams. So, but I will give you my human interest version of the story from\nmy perspective only. We made Red Dead Revolver, decided that, or finished Red Dead Revolver that had been a Capcom game. And they didn't\nwant to finish it, so we finished it. And they released it in Japan and we released it in the US in, I think, 2004. And decided we would start work on\nan open-world cowboy game for PS3.\nDidn't think too much more about it, and that was when we did a bunch of other stuff to work on. And slowly, 2005, 2006, the game started to come to life. I began\nto meet with the lead designer, Christian Cantamessa, and thrash out a few\nideas and story ideas for the game, and began to think about some stuff. And start thinking about, well, what works for an open-world game? What works for a cowboy game?\nAnd again, I was being lazy or procrastinating. - Can we just on a small tangent, when you mentioned you take notes\nwhen you're being lazy. What do those notes look like? Are they like doodles? - They look like either a yellow pad—\n—or a BlackBerry in those days, or an iPhone in these days. I'll write the subject matter and then just email myself a note.\nHere's a good idea. Here's a good idea. Or it might almost be scribbling on a pad. And then I'll assemble, if they're done digitally, then I'll do, I'll\nassemble them into one long Word file. And then I'll look at them and go, you know, \"Here's an idea, here's an idea, here's an idea.\"\nSee if it comes to anything. See if I now aggregate them together and then read through them. If there's anything coherent there. You know, something about a character like this, or that.\nThis would be a funny line. This is a line for the main character. Actually make the main character work like this. You know, what about this relationship?\nAs you start to just play around with, \"What about if we start in that place, go to that place?\" Start just to play around with all of the different bits and\npieces.

And this idea you'd start in dusty\nAmerican West, which meant we didn't have to make too many trees, and then go to Mexico, and then come back. And we had a sort of loose\nflow. And I was really scared of writing any actual dialogue. And I didn't\nhave a clue how to go about it. And I kept... It'll come, it'll come. And I kept... because I could postpone it for\nages because we were doing GTA IV. And I kept worrying about it. My work was wrapped on GTA IV, but the game wasn't out yet.\nAnd we'd done a bunch of the marketing stuff, and had a little window when I wasn't doing much else. And I took a week with my then girlfriend, now\nwife, who was heavily pregnant with our first child, and we went up to a house upstate and sat there. Well, she, she, she\nsat there, either cooking for me or watching TV or reading. And I just went and sat in the room all day, every day. And just sat there and stared at the computer and\ntried to think about, \"How can I do this so that it doesn't sound ridiculous?\" How can you write in a cowboy\nidiom that feels both slightly contemporary but also gives the game this sort of life and this weight that I want it to have, and think we can\nget away with? And after about three days, it just started to come. And then suddenly I wrote about\nnine, 10 scenes in the next couple of days. And after that, I knew I had it. And it was a bit... I don't know if that's why there was so much\nabout a character caring about his family, because I was just beginning the\nprocess of having a family. - Oh. - So I don't know if that- I don't know to what extent that bled in there, but I think it bled in there to some extent.\n- So that was part of creating the 360-degree characters. - I think so. - Here's this man that is\ncapable, is involved in a lot of violence, who also cares about his family. - He's grown up and he's trying to step away from that and be a man, be\na grown-up. And can he get away from it? And when he can't get away from it, what's he willing to do to save his family?\nAnd that was, I felt, starting to get some idea. I mean, she, well, She hadn't given birth yet, but I was beginning to grapple with the ideas of, \"I'm\ngonna become a parent.\" So I hope some of that... And obviously, then I didn't, probably didn't write any more for six months. So later on we had a child. But certainly for that\nfirst bit, I think some of that began to bleed in there. - ...you got the feeling that you can actually do it. It's true, it's...\nIt could have very easily been ridiculous and not believable, the dialogue between convoys.\n- Yes. - And, yes, I mean, there's probably so much work went into making it feel real and believable. And, and, like, that...\nLike a Shakespearean type of drama, but not the cheesy kind.\n- Well, just wanted it to feel when they spoke. I mean, I, I, I love dialogue. I'm always, you know, I love the sound of\nwords, but just wanted to feel like when they sounded, it didn't sound",

At some level that was all the goal was, and then they felt like this guy was gonna go on this life and\ndeath odyssey and you cared about him. You had to care about his wife and child that he left behind, even though you didn't know them.\n- When did you know how you were going to end Red Dead Redemption One? - I remember I did a meeting with Christian, the\ndesigner. I can't remember what year. Probably some point late 2008, early 2009, and we were discussing the last bit and,\nand, and said, \"I think he's gotta die.\" And he leapt on the idea and went, \"That's... Yes, yes. No, no, wait, no, it can't work.\nGames can't work like that. It can't work if he's dead.\" You know, began to think through, well, if we... Just technically it doesn't work because you have to be able to finish all the stuff\nup, and then began to think through, \"Actually, I think we can make it work if we do it this way.\" And so he then really pushed for that idea,\nand it seemed to... I was like, \"Ah,\" and I was still torn. I thought it was clever narratively but I was torn if it was gonna work\ntechnically as a piece of game design, but I think it did. - Yeah, and spoiler alert, of course, how do we tell the\nstory of that? Well, so he goes through a lot. He does all the... John does all the dirty work of hunting down his old gang and he\nfinally is able to go home and be with his family, be on the ranch, and then the government betrays him and\nsends troops to kill him. And there is dialogue. I mean, that just,\nI think the two times I shed a tear in video game history for me is that dialogue.\nI think John talking to his wife, if I vaguely remember. I think he said, \"I love you.\"\nBut he said very little. He didn't... He made it seem like he's going to see her and his son shortly. That dialogue was\nmasterfully done, like a definition of like less is more. It was just so crisp, that\nand... And, of course, the other one is again, from memory, Arthur riding\nhis horse and the music is playing. It's very hard not to shed a tear during that. Anyway, the dialogue of John talking to his wife\nat the end when he's in a barn and is about to walk out. to face certain death. Do you remember writing that?\n- Oh, yeah. Yeah. But it just... Again, I went... The actor was so good and we've already seen a bunch of his work by then.\nHe had such a good... He was so good at reading those lines that I knew he could give us... that you could feel at that point, like-\n…I think those lines are best when they're really short and punchy. So I knew— - Got it. - I knew he'd be able to make that line sound good.\n- So you were imagining his voice. You were just- - And I think all of those actors on Red Dead\nRedemption One were so strong that they really brought that game to life. If them and Rod, the director, hadn't done such a good job, it would have\nsounded cheesy as hell. - ",

    "text": "You've said that the ending of RDR1 is one of the best things you've been a part of\ncreating. Why is that ending so powerful to you? What does it represent?\n- I think because for the story to work, just from a technical\nchallenge, for the story to work, he had to die. But for a game to work, it felt like a challenge to\nmake him die. It was probably the fourth, fifth, or sixth open-world game I'd worked on, and\nI'd spent all these years before that working out how these stories worked. How to make them work technically, how to make them feel right, how they interacted\nwith the open-form gameplay as best I could. And suddenly we're going to break one of our golden rules, which was, at the\nend of the game, you're freeing the character to go and wrap up all the side stories, to play forever. You're not going to be able to do that in this game because the guy's going to be dead, and we're going to have\nyou play as a different character, and the narrative is going to\nbe compelling enough, if we've done a good job, where you're not going to care about that. Or you're going to be upset that he's dead, but you can actually have this\nemotional moment. So I think it was a big risk from a technical perspective for us to do that, and then\nit worked. So I think that was something that was very… full of fear, and it worked out okay.\nAnd I think people were really upset and angry at us for doing it because they didn't think it was going to happen, but I think they also had that kind of experience you're describing, which is that kind of creative\nmoment where, you know, a transcendent moment with characters in a piece of fiction, which is what we've always aspired to giving people.\n- I mean, it's incredible because I don't think… I don't remember a single video game that has done that before. - Well, I would like to have, at the end of GTA IV, killed Niko, but you couldn't do\nit. You know, the game doesn't work like that. So it was this thing where we hadn't done it, thought about doing it, hadn't done it, and then going, \"Let's\ndo it. Let's take the risk and do it. We can't do it. Let's try.\" And it worked. - Yeah, what about the decision with the son? You know,\nJohn gives so much effort to make sure that Jack doesn't end up in a life of violence. I mean, it's very Godfather-like. It's—\n…he's dragged back into it through revenge. - That was also, the game still had to work as a game. Whether that was the right\nending, 100% the best ending from a pure storytelling perspective, I don't know.\nBut I know that we had to make the game work. - Oh, interesting. - So it was... I think it kind of worked in that way where Jack can't\nescape, but I always also wanted a version of it where Jack did escape, but that wasn't... Both were interesting to me.\n- Can you just dig in a little deeper? What do you mean about for the game to work? It's such a direct... It's like Kubrick talking about for this movie to work,\nit has to have... From my perspective, I just think about the st",

    "text": "ory. What's the technical aspect for the game to work? - It's just the mechanical experience is you have an\navatar you control, and you know, the games don't really end. You have to be able to wander around the world and do stuff.\nSo at the end of the game, you have to be able to wander around with your fairly limited set of\nfeatures, which is you can run up to someone and punch them or shoot them or rob them, or talk to them. And that's\nkind of... or jump on a horse or do all this other stuff. In order for the game still to be fun and people to get this full\n360-degree experience with it, they had to, if they wanted to 100% the game as opposed to just finishing the story, you have to have an\navatar to do that stuff with. So that was the sort of challenge of Jack's\ncharacter, wrapping up the story as Jack. - Oh, there's real power for the avatar to end, the finiteness.\n- Yeah. Both the Red Deads, you obviously change avatars. Which we did, and then did it again. I think there's something interesting about that\nmoment when you change from one character to another, because they are you and they're not you, you know, and then suddenly you're someone else.\n- Mm-hmm. I mean, I was really shaken by that experience, but it's a beautiful experience. It's like an unforgettable\nexperience. What else can video games possibly reach for? You know, to create that experience,\nthat's what great films do, that's what great, great books do. - It's that. I mean, it's that and the world building in games. I think the experience of being in this\nfake place and then taking on these narrative adventures, when that combines, you've got the amazing experience.\n- So who do you think is the best character you've ever created in RDR? So to me, I think definitively Arthur from Red Dead Redemption\n2 is the best character ever created in video games ever.\n- Thank you. - I think there's not even close. I mean, John will be the se-, which is hilarious to say, but those are... John will\nbe a close second, but Arthur is definitively. And you've talked about in that interview, you said that a lot of video games\nwork on the same premise, that you start as a weak person and end up as a strong superhero. But what if you start as a\ntough guy, someone who already is very strong, someone that's emotionally confident of his place in the world? Arthur's journey is not about\nbecoming a superhero because he's almost one at the start, but it's about an intellectual rollercoaster when his worldview gets\ntaken apart. So it's very different than the normal journey of a character.\n- Yeah, in a game... - In a game - ... in order to reverse it. So there were a couple other themes that matched that. So they're guys from the Wild\nWest, but they're being pushed ever further east. So it's almost like an anti-Western. An Eastern. You're traveling east. You're traveling into civilization. And I\ndon't think I would've been grappling with those ideas earlier in my career,\n'cause it was so, you know, this i",

Sort of just the, the, the, the\nprospect of like, real sort of fear of death, realization of death.\n- Yeah. I thought that was really- - as part of the story. - really a fun thing to play with. John dies in Red Dead 1,\nI wanted to top that with Red Dead 2, or do that in a different way. And so the idea that John's death is fairly sudden, and\nso if he's got this long, drawn-out death, then I'd always been obsessed by TB. As diseases go, it's a great literary device.\nYou know, 'cause it is this long, drawn-out, slow death, but in which you are also getting weaker. And my grandfather actually had TB before they invented\nantibiotics and was sent to a sanatorium just after he was... just after he'd had his child, my father,\nand survived, but only three of them out of like 35 survived. So I was always,\ncaptivated by TB as an illness. It felt like it was an interesting thing to play around with\nas an idea, this guy getting weaker who felt like he was immortal and essentially was immortal. He was the protagonist in a video game, he could not die, and\nsuddenly he is becoming mortal. You know, but that helps him see stuff. I thought that was a different way of doing a lead\ncharacter in a game. - Yeah. Do you think it's the greatest character you've ever created?\n- I think he's the best lead character. You know, the lead characters are different from the side characters,\nand I think he's the most rounded and works the best. I kind of...\nHim and Nico are the two I like, you know. They were the two most ambitious.\nSo for me, it's always sort of a toss-up, you know? But then I loved all the stuff, like the art team did such an\namazing job. It was their idea with the journal and that kind of... The way that all the features worked into Arthur's character, I thought that\nwas really... He was really rounded, he worked in lots of different ways really well. I loved his flawed relationship with his old\ngirlfriend, things like that. All the side...

I love Dutch.\nYou know, it was partly because we wrote a few lines for him\nfor the first game, and the actor did such a such an amazing job that when he spoke, it just came to me\nall of their backstory, which I'd been playing around with by that point anyway a little bit in my head.

And there's a father-son relationship with Dutch, with, uh,\nI mean, with Arthur, with John. There's a family feeling to the gang. They explore all of those dynamics, and then the feeling of\nbetrayal and Arthur facing tuberculosis. You're going against the family, going against the father-\nbecause he is transforming his sense of the world, of morality, of all those kinds of things. So all the kind of very\nShakespearean drama is right there. And Dutch is a prominent godlike figure through all of that. Also\nflawed himself. Also a man of good and evil in that,\nframework that they're operating under. - And he's just drowning in his ego at the end. You know, his ego gets the better of him. I think he's a... But there was\nsomething flawed but beautiful in his idealism when he was younger, and that's\nmostly off-camera. And then just so you know, always been as an individual, I've always been very susceptible to charming people.\nAnd he's charming. So I was kind of... I can see how people get captivated. by charming people.

'Cause it can cloud your judgment about human nature.\n- Completely. And that's what's happened with him. And it ended up clouding his judgment about himself. He kind of fell for his own rubbish.\n- Yeah, but also it clouded Arthur's judgment. - Oh, completely. Arthur was completely, you know, platonically in\nlove with him. He was worshiping him. He'd given up his power to him. And then I think for Arthur, the journey is retaking that\npower in the moment of dying. You know, and that's what the whole... that's why I thought that was really interesting.\n- Yeah, it's truly tragic for Arthur to be losing his identity, lifelong identity, and\nsense of belonging, and losing his life at the same time. In facing mortality, he is realizing that he's not all of it has been a lie.\n- But he gets to do some... Well, it depends on what choices you make. But he gets to do some good.

And his backstory too. I mean, Londoner and not... yeah, that...\n- Yeah, I think that was what... you know, just that it... there's something sometimes fun, you know, in... an English person saying the name Gavin is quite funny. I don't know why.\n- So, about the Strange Man, AKA, the Man in Black... Is there some element with Michael and the therapist in Grand Theft Auto V? Like, who is the Strange\nMan? - Well, the Strange Man was again... was, was, was someone we came up with quickly. It... we made Red Dead 1,\nand we... well, were making Red Dead 1, and we'd made this... we felt quite compelling story and quite\ninteresting open world. But... and we'd already made a bunch of Grand Theft Autos, obviously, but unfortunately, we'd taken out the machine guns 'cause it was\na cowboy game, apart from the big fixed position ones. And we'd taken out the cars, and we'd taken out the city and large numbers of pedestrians. So we\nessentially had a game about a dude riding a horse... ...around the desert. And it was quite... and it was quite boring.\nAnd so we then started filling it with content, and we filled it with these... and having to improvise. And we filled it with these things we call random events that would be\nthese sort of motion-capture moments that you could interact with. And it... they were, they were... the designers did an amazing job with those. They were really fun.\nBut there was not enough of them. And then we felt we needed more story 'cause the story was perhaps a little short. So we kind of quite late in development\nstarted putting in almost like these RPG-type content where you go and meet someone. And the way we thought of them was they were like short stories. So you go and meet\nsomeone, they'd set you a slow problem, like go and collect me 15 bunches of flowers. And when you came back, it would resolve your story.\nAnd so then, you know, one would go, \"Go get them for my bride,\" and you come back and the bride's dead. You know, to... We tried to make them like these short stories with a sting in the\ntail. And he came out... as I was trying to come up with ideas for those, as just this\nweird character. And then we built him a bit into the story, where he would unlock as you worked your way through and be a\ncommentary on what you were doing. So he was meant to be a kind of\nmanifestation of your, you know, shadow, your karma, the devil, somewhere, you know, just\nsaw the world. And then we built out his backstory over time\nand decided, you know... And so in Red Dead 2, you could interact with him again and... or not really interact with him.

Is it like a Jungian shadow type of situation?\n- Well, it's sort of, because he knows what you're up to. The connection is... what's never really made clear is, does he know this about everybody?\nLike, is he following you, or is he able, because of the pact he's made with evil forces, able to do this for everybody? I don't think we\nnecessarily ever clarify that. He's certainly able to do it for you. - I mean, there's, sort of narrative-wise, there are techniques to reveal a kind of\nself-reflection analysis of the main character's thoughts. That's why I brought up the therapist with Michael. That was a really powerful,\ninteresting thing to do in a video game. Like, I, I don't think I've seen... That's such a cool... I mean, there's a Sopranos element\nthere, with the therapist. - A little bit, yeah. - I really love an opportunity for a character to just\nself-reflect through that technique. - But it also changed depending on what you'd done. - Yes. - So it was, it was sort of slightly... It wasn't as interactive as it could be,\nbut it was slightly interactive, or slightly responsive to what you'd done. So it felt it was still valid video game content, 'cause it was living, up to a point.\nAnd I just thought the character, Dr. Friedlander, was just funny, 'cause he was awful. So it was like LA. You're in therapy. It's very LA. But it's also very LA, he\nwants to write a book and betray you. Which felt like a good, a good twist. It felt like a Grand Theft Auto\ntherapist. But just like the idea of making the player in a game,\nand games are intrinsically kind of physical, and, you know, you... you walk, you punch things, you run around, you drive cars, you shoot people,\nwhatever. There are these kind of physical fantasies. Trying to put them into a slightly more reflective or metaphysical state for a moment, I think can be really\nfun. - I think, to me, one of the most surprising things about Red Dead Redemption, about video games, that Red Dead Redemption showed is how much\nvalue for storytelling is insanely specific, intricate details.\nIn the story, but also visually. It just added to the feeling that the world is\nreal. So I have to ask, what are some of your, um,\nfavorite insanely specific, intricate details in RDR? I can give you some options. The internet's favorite is horse testicles shrinking in cold weather.\ntesticles shrinking in cold weather. - Yep. Those guys did an amazing job on those.\n- I mean, I just... And there must've been a meeting, and there must've been engineers\nand graphics designers. - It was just, I think just artists. - Artists - Modelers, I think.

I think it just gives a... it's a really fun way of giving you kind of narrative content\nthat is also systemic and procedural. - Yeah. Is it technically really difficult to do for the\ngame, for the game to feel like it remembers you? You know? - Um, I think with modern tech it's not that hard, but there's a\nlot of stuff you need to track to make it interesting. - Yeah, to have a memory. So that's really powerful. The mud physics. So Arthur's boots get\nmuddy and leave actual tracks. I mean, that's just incredible. Really, really incredible. - You know, we made a dusty game. Red Dead 1 is a super dusty game. Make, you know, the\nproblem with cowboys is that if you've tried to make a Greatest Hits of the Cowboy game, and\nthen you've got to make a sequel, you've got to come up with different geography. So that's why the game starts in the snow. So we wanted a game that had snow and mud,\nbecause those were things you hadn't really seen in Red Dead 1. And then the challenge is how do you make mud good in a game? And the guys did an amazing job.\n- I mean, the snowstorm that starts the game, RDR2, I don't remember the last time I've experienced anything\nlike it, but you felt it. I don't know how the hell you do that. It's not just graphics, it's everything. Everything together. I suppose some of the\ndialogue is really important to that. - Also the acting. They feel cold. - Yeah, that's right. - And they feel desperate. There was that feeling of sort of\n- Yes - exodus. Like you're running away from something, that gives the game energy at the start. - And it was at night. Oh man, it was just masterfully done.\n- And there was a big group of them.

Again, those decisions that you make\nreveal themselves in the game across time. And they're consistent. I don't know. I did not see many games do that. It must be difficult to\ndo, but to give that level of care to the details in that way across time and for specific\ngraphical representations of things is incredible. - Yeah.

Is there any\nscenes that you had to let go of that you really miss or wish you could've\ndone in either GTA or RDR? - Well, I think the games ended up the way they were supposed to be.\nYou know, I think there was always... There was a bit at the start of RDR\nwhere he'd had a baby who just died in Red Dead 2, and we ended up cutting it, which\nwas the right decision. It was too tough in some ways. But I think it gave him real... He was not\nvery sympathetic to his occasional girlfriend who'd had the baby. And so, it made him very, very nasty at the start, which I thought would be interesting to\nplay around with because then it would make his redemptive arc even more interesting. He was not a likable character at the start, and that was one...\nWe ended up making him slightly more like... He was still sort of tough and nasty, but he's slightly more likable early on. That was the right decision\ncommercially. It's better that way. But you know, I still like that little bit. It spoke to me personally. And just his inability to\naccess his emotions I thought was really strong because then later in the game he's getting very emotional. But there are also always little bits and pieces that\nget trimmed. You know, and don't... Or missions that just are not going to work technically. Usually, it's like, \"This mission's not going to work\ntechnically. Oh God, we have to cut it. Okay, how do we glue the story back together?\" We got better over time at gluing the story\nacross missing chunks. You get late in the game, and it's just something, you know, some big challenging moment just is going to look rubbish, so you just get rid of\nit. - I think editing film, and I imagine editing video games, editing down\nis an art form, but it's also just... It feels like torture because you're letting go of things you put so much love into.\n- Yeah, it could be changes.

Otherwise, you can care about it.\nBut, you know, if I was involved in the big creative thing and you go, \"Okay, it's the right decision,\" I can probably live with that fine.\nI think sometimes for designers when they're only designing four or five missions in the whole game and two of them get cut, that must be really... ...Really hard.\nDLCs for GTA and Red Dead",

I always wished I'd done more. - What would you have added? This is a fun, like, nerding out.\n- We... the internet knows we made a DLC, single-player DLC for GTA V that never came out. And we've also never really\nworked on another game. But I like... the idea of it, it was a GTA zombie game. That would've been funny. I think that could've been quite fun.\n- What was the GTA V DLC? - It was one where you played as Trevor, but he was a secret agent.\n- Oh. - It was... it was cute. It never quite came together, and it was never finished. It was about half done when it got abandoned. But I think if that had come out, probably wouldn't have gotten\nto make Red Dead 2. So, there's always compromises. But it was... you know, I like making the stories. For me, I love the model of\nGTA IV when you had the extra stories coming afterwards or Red Dead 1 when you had the zombie pack coming afterwards. I like just doing these\nextra things. So, I would've personally liked to have done more of that in that company. Um,\nand with stuff we're doing in the future, we're going to try and come up with worlds where we can add more stories.\nI like single-player DLC. I just think the audience loves it, and it's really fun to make. - Does it make you a little bit sad that the gaming industry, in general, is\nmoving towards more online, less single-player DLC? Maybe that observation is incorrect. But it feels at\nthis moment, to me, it feels like, It's easier to make a lot of money with online...\n- If you get it right. - If you get it right. And so the game companies are reaching for that. And\nit just makes me really sad because there's so much power to the... What you did with Red Dead Redemption 2, I don't know how during that time you were able to pull that off, but that\nwas like a breath of fresh air. Or, in a time where everybody was moving to online and there was that huge incentive to that, you go\non and draw, again, the greatest narrative in video game history and the greatest character in video game history, single-player.\n- We still love single player games.

Luckily, if you want to do what we're forced to do and\nalso what I want to do, which is make new IP, you need single player games. You can launch a multiplayer game as with new IP.\nIt's just extremely hard. So, luckily, we are focusing on what we're good at, which is open world single player games.\nAnd we might add multiplayer components to one of them. I think one of them is going to be really tough, later\non. But we're still thinking that through.

So, like, worlds... - Oh, yes - ...or pirate games? I mean, what... I would love to see the notes, the possible\noptions. - Never thought a lot about a pirate game. - Yeah? - My son is obsessed with that game, Sea of Thieves, at the moment, so he's constantly\nsaying, \"Do a pirate game.\" Haven't really thought about it too much. We worked a lot on multiple iterations of an open world spy game.\n- Yeah. - And it never came together. - So Agent? - Agent, and it's had about five different ... iterations\n- ... so good. - I don't think it works. I concluded I, and I keep thinking about it sometimes. I sometimes lie in bed thinking about it, and I've\nconcluded as an open, as what makes them really good\nas film stories makes them not work as video games. We need to think through how to do it in a different way as a video game.\n- So for people who don't know, it would be hypothetically set in the 1970s Cold War era. - That was one of the versions. There was another one that was set in current. We had so\nmany different versions of this game. - Got it. - We worked on so many different teams. - But it would be more geopolitical, like espionage-\n- That, yeah, espionage, like... - ... and assassinations. - Yeah, assassinations. I don't know what it would've been 'cause it never really...\nWe never got it enough to even do a proper story on it. We're doing the early work as you get the world up and running. It never really found its feet in either of them.\n- So interesting. - And I sort of think I know why, because one of those films, they're very, very frenetic\nand they beat to beat to beat. You gotta go here and save the world. You gotta go there and stop that person being killed and then save the world. An open-world\ngame does have moments like that when the story comes together. But for large portions, it's a lot kind of looser, and you're just hanging out and doing what you\nwant. I want freedom. I wanna go over here and do what I want, and I wanna go over and do what you want. That's why it works well being a criminal, because you fundamentally don't have anyone telling you what to\ndo. We try and create, you know, external agency through these people kind of forcing you into the story at\ntimes. But as a spy, that doesn't really work because you have to be against the clock. So I think for me, I question if you can even make a good open-world spy game.\n- So interesting. So you have to be able to ride around in a car and listen to the radio. - Yeah, and cruise about. - Or ride a horse and just look at nature.\n- So lots of things would work as open-world games, but I don't know if a spy does. - That's brilliantly put.

And in this weird company that was constantly in trouble. So it was really fun.\n- Just even looking back at that time to today, how did you evolve as a creative mind across those 20 years?\n- Well, I was a child. I was a 25-year-old child. I didn't know anything, and I wanted to be a writer.\nBut I still wasn't writing. And I bought a notebook and I'd occasionally scribble in it, and I've still got those notebooks somewhere. And I was working in video\ngames, which were the least literary medium it's possible to imagine at the time. There was no room for that on PS1 games,\nreally. Thinking I needed to stop and do something else, but not having the skills or the confidence to do\nit. And I'd been doing that in London. Then I came to New York, and it was fun, really fun to be in New York and really fun to do a\nnew company in New York. And that was an amazing adventure, but I was still lost as a human being. And then when I was 27, I was still\ncompletely lost, a child.

He's just a great partner because he likes, you know,\n...like me, we just like making stuff. He likes to make stuff. He likes to work in new spaces. He's been a great help on bringing the comic book to life,\ndoing a lot of the work on that. He's working on that right now.

No question. - Tetris and the Game Boy, yeah. - It was the perfect device for playing that game. I never liked it as much on anything\nelse. When my wife was trying to get a retro one for my kids, trying to get them for Christmas right now.\nIt was the most addicted I ever was to anything in my life, of far too many addictions. I was obsessed by it, dreaming about it, and when you link\ntwo together with the cable and if I got four, it would push yours forward. It was like the perfect game design. So from a pure puzzle perspective, nothing comes close.\n- Yes. Extremely simple. Pure gameplay. No narrative. - No, nothing. No personality at all. It's a completely different thing.\n- Perfection. - But perfect in its way. Open World games can't be that perfect. But you always dream of making something like that.\n- And Super Mario. - I think the N64 ones.\nAll of those early 3D games were very amazing when you first saw them.\nOn the N64, PS1, when you went, it suddenly was like these games, they're alive, and they're believable in a different way. I think\nthat was very interesting. - It looks nothing like anything else. - Nintendo has that look, doesn't it? Always.\n- Yeah.

It feels like when you watch a Hitchcock film, it's\nnot reality. He's speaking the language of cinema in a very, very strong, with a very strong accent almost. It's very, very cinematic. It's\nnot realism at all. And that's what those Zelda games kind of feel like to me. They are these amazing things that could only be video games. They couldn't be anything\nelse. - For me, another really powerful open world is The Elder Scrolls world. It's role-playing, it's fantasy, dragons, all that kind of stuff.\n- Todd is great at what he does. It is. They're slightly, they're more...\nI mean, from a technical perspective, we're always involved. I mean, with the new games, we're constantly trying to find the\nbalance between, you know, an RPG, a role-playing game, and an action\ngame. And then, you know, try to go, \"Well, an action-adventure game with RPG elements.\" And what does that mean? And I think they've all kind of moved into roughly the same\nspace. But for me, it always just comes down to, are... is it easy to play? Are our mechanics super slick? And then can we keep our dialogue feeling very alive?\nLike, I'm not always a great... For just what we do, I like when other people do it. For what we do, we always want very punchy dialogue. So,\ndon't give big trees, but still have it interactive. So we're going to lose a touch of interactivity, but we'll still have the dialogue\nfeeling like it's alive. But we'll get better at dialogue, and it'll feel a slightly more cinematic experience.\n- Yeah, I think The Elder Scrolls series has almost always leaned a little more towards the open world.\n- Yes, they're real RPGs. You know, we've not... The games that I've worked\non, they've not really been RPGs. They've had RPG elements onto a story-driven action game.

It's hard to get them all, and you know as a As a game-making team, the whole team kind of\nhave to figure out where they want to fall on that line. - On a difficult topic, you dedicated the book to your mom and dad.\nLife lessons from father\nAnd in particular, you wrote, \"To my father, who died while I was finishing the\nbook.\" What have you learned about life from your dad?\n- To show up. To be present. To go to work every day. To love\ncreative things. He was a lawyer, but he was also a jazz musician,\nand he did both to the best of his abilities. To value family as\nmore important than either of those things. He was a present guy,\nI think. And, you know, he loved books, always loved books, always loved films, loved music. He wasn't into video games, but liked that we were doing weird things.\n- Was he proud of you? - Yeah, I think so. I hope so. He was, for a lawyer...\nHe really venerated at some level, giving \"the man\" the\nfinger. Like, whenever life goes crazy— he was always on the side of the underdog and the ridiculous. And I\nthink that, you know, he always wanted to answer people back, always give the silly comment. I certainly have taken\nthat from him, to my detriment probably, but it makes life more fun. He always would just say the obnoxious thing and just didn't give a fuck.\nAnd that was, I think that was probably quite inspiring. - So you have a bit of that in you?\n- Unfortunately so, yes. Not good at shutting up, not good at toeing the line.\n- I think I speak for most of human civilization that fortunately you have that as part of who you\nare, because it comes through your stories. - I think it made school difficult. They sent me to this very formal school—\nthat was like, it might as well have been set in the 1870s, in the 1990s. And, but then, I always got in trouble\njust for... not doing anything that wrong, just answering teachers back all of the time. I couldn't be quiet.\nMortality\n- How often do you think about mortality? Are you personally afraid of death?\n- Well, my father passed away in May, so a lot more since then, obviously. I mean, I\nthink about it a lot. Am I afraid of it? I don't know. Some days intensely and some days not at all. I would love to stay\nalive long enough to see my kids properly grow up and settled, of course, for them. Aside from that, some days I\nfeel, you know, spiritually connected to the universe and not afraid of death at all. And other days I feel like a sort of\nrandom piece of good luck who's gonna get struck down by an angry fate and turn to nothingness, and that terrifies me.\n- What do you think about the nothingness? I mean, that- that in itself is terrifying. - Yeah, that is terrifying. I mean, I tend to,\nI tend to, you know, I've spent long periods of my life tormented by that stuff.\nThe last few years, I tend to believe there is a purpose and a point to life, and that we have some kind of\nspiritual or soul-based existence.

But at other points you know, if you read too much science, you get wrapped up in the nothingness of it all.\n- Also, there's a component to your brain. When talking about Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë, you said that you have been, by\nfortune, struck with a bit of a capacity for the grandiosity of feeling. So you feel the world deeply, sometimes\nromantic, sometimes overly romantic. You've said, I like this line, \"Feelings may destroy you, but they're the best thing we have.\" So that\nability to feel the world, is that a gift or a curse for you? What do you think?\n- That's a really interesting question because it's obviously both. At times it's both, or at times it's one or the other. When things are going well, when you feel\nalive, when you feel like you're connected to things, when you're seeing\nbeauty in people and joy in experiences, of course it's it's wonderful. When you're feeling like, you know, bereft and\nset adrift by the world and that you can't connect to it in some way and you're lost and abandoned by\nGod or consciousness or fate or whatever it is, it's awful. You know, when I feel like\na dreadful hack, which is most of the time, you know, it's terrible. You'd rather not be doing this rubbish. And then sometimes you're working creatively and it feels good and you feel like you're doing\nthe right thing and it feels fantastic, but that's not very often. - Do you think it's possible to have one without the other?\n- No. No, of course not. When I think about growing up to the extent that\nI am capable of growing up it is about accepting the bad with the good from any situation\nor any aspect of myself. You know, going, \"Okay, it's not perfect. I'm not perfect.\"\n- You said you often feel like a hack. Is that that self-critical part of your brain, is that a feature or a bug?\n- That's an, I think it's that new thing that we're gonna lean into, the bug feature. It's both, isn't it? I mean, it cannot lead... That\nself-critical brain, I think lots of people suffer from it, and I think the internet is designed to induce, if you didn't have it before, you will have it after\nbeing online. It clearly can become a bug but it also can give you drive and a lack of complacency,\nso it can also become a feature. - I had a pretty intense argument with Paul Conti, who's a\nlegendary psychiatrist, student of the mind, about this. He worked with many\nfamous creative people and he thinks that that negative voice is not at all needed for creative\ngenius. And I thought, \"I know awfully a lot of creative people that have that voice.\"\n- I'd rather not have it, but I certainly have lived with it this far. There's a\ndanger that negativity...

Of course, you know, everyone who ever puts something on the internet,\nbe it a picture of themselves or any kind of work they've made or whatever it is, is going to get 50 good comments and one bad comment. Remember the bad\ncomment. So that, and that, that becomes fuel for the negative voice. I don't know anyone that's strong enough not to. You know, we all, you know, at some level you should\njust measure that stuff in weight, not in quality. But of course we just focus on the quality. - And I do think in general, as you get older, that's the real challenge for people. You\ncan see the different trajectories people choose to take. But it's easy to slip into cynicism and negativity, into this,\nDostoevsky's Notes from Underground, nihilistic kind of worldview. I think the heroic action to\ntake with time is to become more optimistic, to see more good. I think that-\n- I agree. - There's probably a hero's journey of being extremely self-critical at first,\nfor the first, maybe half of your life or two-thirds, and then,\nwhile maintaining some self-critical aspects just so you stay humble, start to see the good in everything around\nyou, in other people, in the world, and even maybe every once in a while on a weekend, in yourself.\n- I hope so. I mean, that's what I've been, I could not be more cynical. I think you put that beautifully.\n- Yeah. - I could not be more cynical than I was as a child. You know, I could not see goodness anywhere. I couldn't see, you know, I don't think\nlate 1970s to early 1990s England was a great, was a place of great, you know, optimism and naiveté.

    "text": "ime. And I should also give a shout-out to an excellent podcast he did with Sonia\nWalger, who's a friend of yours, but she had a great podcast. She has guests pick their five favorite, most impactful books and so on.\nYou picked five fiction books, one for each decade of your life. For the audience, they should go listen to that conversation.\nBut you picked Winter Holiday by Arthur Ransome. Second one was Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë.\nThen Tender Is the Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Thin Red Line by James Jones, and Middlemarch by George Eliot.\nBut just zooming out, reflecting back on that conversation, what do you think, if an alien came, what are some candidates for books\nthat you would recommend to them? - Middlemarch. It's the best novel written in English.\nWar and Peace is one of the best novels written in Russian, I would argue. I think both of those are...\nBecause if you've only got one book, you want a long book. - Yeah, true. - And then they're both books that kind of...\nIt's something I was always trying to put into games, and you know, that feeling of all of life is here. You know, you've got love, death, violence, romance,\nthe whole human experience in different ways. So I think there's something amazing about, you know, Vanity Fair, I used to love the novel, not the magazine.\nBecause same thing, all of life is here. - You also spoke highly of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Hemingway.\n- I was obsessed by them in my 20s. - Yeah. - Completely obsessed. - As one must be. - Yeah.\n- Absolutely. - At that age, and I think them as a double act is so amazing. You know, one helped discover the other and then died first, and then suddenly\ndied in obscurity and then was rediscovered as a genius while the other one was still alive and falling into decline,\nI think their relationship is itself very novelistic. - That, by the way, is a phenomenon of writing maybe no\nlonger, maybe still, you know, people like Franz Kafka who died in obscurity.\nAll these writers who die in obscurity. Nobody knows them and they become famous later. That is just so interesting. That's such an interesting...\nYou know, Franz Kafka. Kafka in particular is fascinating because he wanted all of his work to be burned,\nlike destroyed. So that, speaking of the critical voice, and I think he's one of the,\none of the best writers of the 20th century. Of course, the dystopian novels are really interesting: 1984, Brave New World.\n- Love 1984. Had never listened to it or read it, and then I think I did it on Talking Book, or I maybe read it, I can't remember, during COVID.\nI think I did both, became obsessed by it. And it's got the elements of that creeping into A Bed of Paradise. But it's so good.\nI hadn't realized how good it was. - Yes. - And it's so of the moment. - It's almost like because of its fame, and...\nit's almost like cliché, and you take away the character- - Yeah, if it were English...

I came to it completely cold, just, \"Oh, I\nshould work my way through this 'cause it's another classic I haven't read.\" And then it's incredible.\n- And the book I've read more than any other book is Animal Farm by George Orwell. I don't know why exactly, but the childlike fairy tale-telling of totalitarianism.\n- Well, you grew up in a communist country. - Yeah. Maybe that's it. The roots of it. - You know, I remember, I was a kid in the Cold War in\nLondon. And we were always terrified of Eastern Europeans, \"You're gonna come and kill us all.\" And then I ended up marrying a Pole. And I was... We were... And we had\nUkrainians, you know, who worked for us and worked with us. And I was... We were sitting, a few years ago, sitting around a\ncampfire in Upstate New York, with the campfire built by our old nanny's husband, who's Ukrainian, and he'd been in the Red\nArmy.

You know, and we face some of that now, where you think these structures are permanent, and they're\ngonna change. - And you also mentioned that the three great World War II books are The Thin Red\nLine, Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman. And The End of the Affair, Graham Greene. What makes for a great war book?\n- I think World War II is interesting because it affects everywhere, obviously. And so you can get all these different\nkinds of stories. And there's so many good... I was just trying to come up with a range of one American, one British, one\nEastern European just to get different perspectives. But there's so many amazing World War II books around all kinds of stories. I think\nthe most complete one, because it is this all of life being there, probably is Life and Fate, which is amazing.\n- It was written by Vasily Grossman. He experienced Stalingrad firsthand. And there's also just a deep philosophical component.\n- And the bit in Treblinka is one of the most harrowing sections of any book I ever read. And it really, almost more than any other piece of art around the Holocaust,\nmade me feel what you would feel like at that moment. I mean, it's just incredible piece of humanism.\n- And also, I mean, Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. - Yeah. Oh, yeah. - It seems like that context reveals, in the most\npure way, human nature and like what kind of... You know, in Man's Search for Meaning is when everything is taken from you, you know, the little\nremains of love for, in this case, his wife... is the thing that is a little flame that burns.\nAnd let's say your Grossman is small acts of kindness,\nis the thing that allows the human spirit to persist. - I love the bit in Life and Fate when you get...

But I don't think it's that trivial. It's this idealism of humans.\nIt's like, why, you know, why can't... Basically, why can't we all get along? There's a real compassion behind it. There's real love. And what you realize is\nthere is... It's a real study, the 20th century, of human nature. that, unfortunately, at scale, that kind of compassion is abused by\ncentralized power. So there's a dictator always, in that context, given that set of technologies, a dictator arises and does the opposite\nof what the promise of the ideal is supposed to be. - Well, I think I thought a lot about that\nthen because I was taught by all these disappointed communists, you know? After '89, all of these English communists, you know, were all like having to\naccess, discovering all these atrocities that happened. You know, so it always fascinated me.

And I was like, \"Well, if I stay in South\nAmerica much longer, I'm going to get myself killed,\" 'cause this was when I was getting into silly stuff.\nAnd so I went to New York, and they were just starting Rockstar. I got to sort of write the mission statements and whatnot there, and help set the tone for\nthat and just ended up staying. I had to come and go a bit while all visas got sorted out. And then I just ended up\nstaying, \"I'll stay for a year 'cause New York's pretty fun.\" It actually was not that-- this was the height of Giuliani before he was a maniac. So\nyou couldn't-- when you went to bars, you were told you couldn't dance. 'Cause they were trying to clamp down on New York being fun. So it was actually less fun than London, but there's still a great energy in New York.\nAnd I got exposed to the kind of madness of New York capitalism. - By the way, as we hear sirens in the background, that always makes me think of New York.\n- Yeah, of course. - Whenever I'm in New York... - Yeah - ...there's always sirens. - Steam coming out the floor, people screaming at you. I mean, you get people screaming at\nyou in LA, at least. - Yeah, but it's more distributed, it's more, uh... - Yeah, it's more spread out. - ...spread out, yeah. - You can get a bit more quiet here.\nI love the energy. It was great to work hard and then be able to go out for dinner late. And New York was really, really a fun experience for me.\n- You worked with your brother, Sam, for many years. What do you admire\nabout him as a creative mind, as a human being? - His drive and his vision early on to see what video games could\nbecome. He was the one who understood that video games were the next big thing. And I think that was, you know, people would\nlaugh in our face about that in those days. To have s",

I still look... I'm glad you've spoken so, I mean, you've spoken\nso kindly about our work, about the stuff that I did, and the stuff the whole teams did. It's wonderful. But I just\nlook at it and see problems and see things that we can make do better. You know, I think it was always, try each time to do it better. And some of the stuff we're working on now\nis going to do stuff that people haven't really seen before. I think it's just, I think that\ngames can get so much better. They can feel so much more alive. They can be better at storytelling and feel more alive and feel\nlike, you know, their systems, all the stuff, the component parts we talked about. We can make each of those parts better.\nand tie them together better. I think the technology still feels like it's only just beginning. Cinema evolved from, like, 1900, 1895, whenever it was, until\nthey invented talking in 1930 or whenever that was. It's not that. Then it kind of found its modern form, and then by '39, they're shooting in\ncolor. Basically, a modern film is no different from a 1939 film. But with games, I still think we've got a long way to go. The tech...\nThere are so many different parts of the tech that still have a long way to go, and you can go in all different fun directions.\n- I just wish... and I know you said video games take a lot less than they could, but I just wish it was faster. Like, you've already made me...\n- Me too - fall in love with Absurdiverse and you've made me fall in love with The Better Paradise, and now I'm going to sit depressed, realizing we'll have to\nwait. I could, of course, read. - Well, we should have some little short cartoons coming out in a while\nfor Absurdiverse and more stuff coming in the next period. But yeah, it just takes a little bit of time. I mean,\nbig movies are four years plus from start to end. You know, with all the legal stuff at the start. We'll be about the same.\n- Yeah, and certain movies from idea to completion, I mean, take 10 plus years for some of the greats.\n- Yeah, often. A lot of that is just that development process. that is really... Sometimes it feels like it's designed to not make stuff.\n- A bit more specific advice, but on the topic of video games, what advice would you give to maybe independent video game\ncreators that are dreaming of creating great games? They're inspired by Red Dead. They're inspired by all the\nincredible open worlds and narratives you've created. How's it possible to have a chance at doing something like that?\n- I mean, it's part of... There's two ways: try and do it cheaply with yourself and a small group, or join a company that you think\nis doing it the right way, you know? And I think there's upsides to either of those.

But the second you're involving actors and motion capture and one of those big experiences,\nit's going to cost some money. So therefore, if you want to do that, you've got to figure out what companies you want to work at and figure out how you get to work there.\n- Do you have hope for AI helping with some of the video generation, some of the world\ngeneration, or some of the open world assistance in generating the world?\n- Yes. Limited. Absolutely, if used correctly, it will be a great tool. If used incorrectly, it will lead to loads of generic stuff.\nYou know, I've been in games for 29 years and all the time, the piece of tech that's going to make making games much easier and much cheaper is about to turn\nup, and all that's happened is the games have got much better and way more expensive.

Ни с одной женщиной. Ни с одной женщиной. Ни с одной никогда\nни с каким журналистом, ни с каким или с кем-то, у кого я бы брал интервью или кто-то, кто у меня бы брал интервью.\nВажная новость прошлого года - это работа китайских учёных, которые смогли позволить двум почтенным джентльменам\nне просто родить детей, но и увидеть внуков.\nЕсли собираетесь в отпуск за границу, а кредитки не работают, советую вам\nвиртуальную криптокарту Maxw. Её можно подключить к Apple и Google Pay и оплачивать покупки прямо с\nкриптокошелька. А затратами удобно следить в приложении. Ищите его по\nссылке в описании. Илья Колмановский, кандидат биологических наук, научный\nобозреватель, автор подкаста \"Голый землекоп\". Очень рада видеть тебя сегодня.\nПривет. А хочу спросить, какое слово года ты бы\nназвал вот в мире науки? А Кеннеди младший.\nО боже, серьёзно? Этот антиваксер и человек, который вообще портит науку.\nНу да, по степени воздействия этой кувалды как бы ни с чем не сравнить.\nРоберт Кеннеди младший, министр здравоохранения США, назначенный Дональдом Трампом, который радикально\nперекроил американскую науку. При нём уже остановлены многочисленные исследования, в том числе в области\nонкологии или, например, болезни Хантингтона. Инициатор беспрецедентного пересмотра всего графика детских\nпрививок, начал жёсткую чистку кадров, заменяя чиновников лояльными к его курсу\nспециалистами. У меня была идея, что мы про плохие новости будем говорить в конце.\nНет, ну ты знаешь, чат GPT, кстати, не такой пессимист, как ты. Он как бы\nназывает слово жизнь главным словом года. И что было много открыты год, можно так сказать, всё время. И мы будем\nмного говорить про жизнь. У меня очень, видимо, своя оптика какая-то специфическая. Я обожаю наший тобой\nвстречи. По-моему, это седьмая. Я весь год к ней готовлюсь. Что же я скажу? И,\nэ, какой-то у меня очень свой взгляд и выбор. Понятно, что каждый год\nпроисходит что-нибудь важное про всё ещё совсем непонятные нам вещи о том, как устроена жизнь, как из комочка клеток\nвот благодаря этим миллиардам букв получается именно вот такое тело, а не другое тело, а не кактус, а не жираф, а\nне муха. И всё ещё очень мало понятно, да? Там про мозг в этом смысле каждый\nгод можно говорить, что словом года был мозг. Вот в прошлом году было совершенно как-то просто у нас с тобой, потому что\nтогда словом года были нейросети и глубокое обучение, потому что обыденность именно. Поэтому я хотел предложить\nБеременность от нейросети: как ИИ находит сперматозоиды\nначать просто наш разговор с истории о том, как человек забеременел от искусственного интеллекта, и дальше уже\nсчитать, что все сюжеты, которые мы будем обсуждать, в них принял участие искусственный интеллект.

Так, мужчины, женщины, мужчины, женщины пока что. Так, мы\nсейчас, кстати, перейдём, а, к другим каким-то комбинациям. Но если мы пока что будем говорить про эту пару, то у\nних очень характерная история, когда в аякуляте, э, есть, по идее, живые сперматозоиды, но маловато.\nУгу. Ну и в норме вот природа рассчитала такой запас в одном икуляте, что 100 млн сперматозоидов. Тогда, может быть,\nкто-нибудь добежит, пробьёт на самом деле очень серьёзную защиту яйцеклетки, она как бы отбирает лучших и случится\nоплодотворение. Но вот один из очень характерных сценариев бесплодия - это когда их там маловато. Это статистические процессы.\nМожно вот пытаться ещё раз и ещё раз и в следующую опуляцию, в следующую не получается. И в этой ситуации у врачей\nкак бы есть задача дать нечестное преимущество каким-то немногочисленным ребятам. Надо для этого создать\nконцентрат. И можно в микроскоп смотреть, посадить много трудолюбивых лаборантов и двое суток искать. И вот\nконкретная конкретная цифра. Они за двое суток в одном якуляте не нашли ничего. Вот как бы такой уровень проблемы. И\nтогда врач а подумал, что вообще похожую задачу искать иголку в стоги сена.\nВообще у нас у всех же в этом году были всякие разговоры с чатом GPT, разными другими нейросетями. Я думаю, вы все заметили, что он нам врёт и часто делает\nнас менее продуктивными. Но если мы формулируем промт так, чтобы он нам нашёл иголку в стоги сена, то мы тут же\nвидим, есть эта иголка или нету. Тогда всё просто. И он подумал, что есть вот учёные, которых всё время стоит такая\nзадача, потому что они смотрят на небо и ищут там новые звёзды. Это, мне кажется, страшно романтично. А потому что\nдействительно каждый день делаются сотни тысяч снимков. Надо найти где-нибудь\nнеспыхла новая звезда. И теперь этим занимаются наросети. И он буквально взял эти наросети у коллег. Он назвал свою\nмодификацию Star Sperm Tracking. Что-то красиво. И там был такой чип, где икулят\nбежит по очень тонкой трубочке или большому количеству тонких трубочек, и нейросеть успевает очень быстро смотреть\nна миллионы сперматозоидов.\nИ как всегда бывает в этих историях, наросить сама решила себе, по каким критериям она отбирается из них живых. И\nкогда с её точки зрения бежит живой, она открывает люк, и он проваливается в специальный отсадник, отстойник. И в\nтаком же якуляте, где люди за двое суток не нашли ничего, за час эта нейросеть нашла 44 живых и заморозила. И дальше\nона набрала достаточно на достаточное количество оплодотворения. Не знаю, сколько яцеклеток взяли, но физически\nэто факт. Человек забеременел. GPT может врать, но тут нельзя как бы сомневаться.\nОна забеременла буквально как бы от Святого Духа, да. Вот муж её был уже не очень плодовит, но вот привлекли ещё\nСвятого Духа. А, и мне кажется, это подвелось вот всей этой истории, да, про нейросети.\nСлушай, ну всё, что он проделал, чем это отличается от",

Хорошо.\nМыши от двух отцов: как китайские ученые создали потомство из двух самцов\nТы спросила, какого пола были родители. А, конечно, важная новость прошлого года - это работа китайских учёных, которые\nсмогли позволить двум почтенным джентльменам не просто родить детей, но и увидеть\nвнуков. Правда, эти джентльмены были мыши. И тут дело не обошлось ещё без другого инструмента, который будет\nпричастен ко всем моим историям, наверное, сегодня. Это редактор Крис Парс девять. Угу.\nМолекулярный редактор, который позволяет редактировать гены. А судебное дело вокруг патента, про\nкоторые в этом году возобновилось заново между двумя нобелевскими лауреатками и ещё и конкурентом с Гарварта. Это\nбольшая драматическая история. Дженнифер Дудна, Имануэль Шарпантье заново судятся. Но важно, что этот и\nпохожие на него инструменты и в этом году, как и в прошлые и последние несколько лет, продолжал\nсовершенствоваться и позволяет невероятной точностью что-нибудь менять в ДНК и что-нибудь там переписывать. В этом случае действительно надо было вот\nпроталкивать верблюдо в игольное ушко и без генетической редактуры не получалось. Тут дело какое? А и почему\nвообще это ценно? И зачем они этим занялись? И зачем вот им нужны были эти внуки? Не только и не столько потому,\nчто китайских учёных заботится это возможность для однополых пар родить когда-нибудь ребёнка. Я не уверен, что они сильно этим озабочены.\nВообще этим интересуются. Да. Да. Но а я бы на их месте подумал бы про это, потому что люди перестают рожать\nдетей. А в Китае рождаемость отрицательная, и люди быстро сейчас начнут стареть, и вся\nэта их производительность труда быстро на этом закончится, и человечество будет стареть. Если кого-то дополнительно\nмотивирует идея, что этот ребёнок будет биологически наш, то, мне кажется, во всеобщих интересах, чтобы все технологии\nпродвигались. А дествен пугали перед населением, но, кажется, сейчас другой сценарий\nнаступает. Вся команда Поговорить работает\nудалённо. Наши герои разбросаны по миру и сотрудники тоже.

И\nони должны дальше решить между собой ещё какие гены из набора будут преобладать\nвот, скажем, в этой паре генов, а в другой паре генов другие. А всего генов 20.000 или 30.000 у человека, да? И\nпонятно, что многие проблемы с ранним прерыванием беременности и плохим развитием могут быть связаны с этим, что\nэтот диалог пошёл как-то не по тому сценарию.

Самка номер один. У неё взяли яйцеклетку, выкинули оттуда её геном\nи пропуская сложные детали, в итоге можно сделать так, чтобы там, в этой яйцеклетке объединились геномы от двух\nмужских особей. Это не такая сложная вещь. Что было сложно, то что дальше оно всё не хотело развиваться, потому что\nэти два мужских набора не могли договориться между собой, как будет происходить вот этот так называемый импринтинг, как будет происходить этот\nвыбор. И тут им пришлось смешаться и произвести 19 разных редактур. Это были\nне совсем обычные самцовые геномы в этом смысле, но пока они их делали, они одновременно поняли очень много и\nважного о том, как работает этот механизм.

Ты\nпомнишь, мы говорили, что одной из важных вех в этой истории была женщина,\nКлещ-вегетарианец, аллергия на стейки и ГМО-свиньи\nкоторая очень любила есть стейки. Её звали Эмми. И у неё во взрослом возрасте развилась\nаллергия на мясо. И это связано с тем, что её заразил вегетарианством клещ, клещ одинокой\nзвезды, у которого на брюшке есть одинокая звезда, точечка. И с её кейса\nвообще началось внимание к этой проблеме. Ой-ой-ой, мы сейчас все будем плакать. Потому что, видите ли, 100\nамериканцев не могут больше есть стейки. И они во взрослом возрасте, это проблема людей первого мира, да, что они во\nвзрослом возрасте получили аллергию на красное мясо. Это очень необычно. Врачи в это сначала не верили, не помогали\nэтим людям, но стало понятно, что их клещ заразил вегетарианство.\nНо только вот в этом году впервые человек умер съев стейк, и стало\nпонятно, что сейчас их уже не 200, как когда я впервые этим заинтересовался, а их примерно 100.000. Потому что с\nизменением климата и с распространением этих клещей людей они всё чаще кусают.\nОбъясняется, что когда клещ пьёт кровь у какого-нибудь скота, Угу. он получает такую большую дозу вещества\nиз крови этого скота, который называется альфагал. Это некая молекула некого\nсахара, которая растёт на поверхности всех клеток большинства млекопитающих, кроме обезьян старого света и людей.\nПоэтому для нашего иммунитета это чужеродное вещество. Мы спокойно едим мясо с кота, потому что в желудке всё\nэто распадается. Но если клещ, который всю жизнь ел кровь\nэтих животных, у которого в слюных железах гигантская концентрация этого вещества укусит человека, то он получает\nтакую огромную дозу этого вещества, что его иммунитет понимает, что это что-то очень опасное, начинает выделять\nантитела, и в следующий раз, когда он съест стейк, даже сквозь слизистую оболочку желудка,\nиммунитет почувствует эту атаку и даст очень сильные иммунная реакции.\nИ примечательно, что впервые умер человек от этого укуса. А значит, делается актуальная история, которая\nздесь была совершенно ключевой. Дело в том, что когда Эми выступила в подкасте Radi Lab,\nда, про это услышали учёные, которые к этому моменту уже 20 лет разрабатывали свою\nочеловеченную свинью, у которой нет этого альфагал. Это одна из ключевых\nредактур, которая сделана в этой очеловечной свинье. Угу. И как они смогли пробить стену в\nправительстве? Что они сделали? Ведь, ну, нельзя было прийти в правительство и сказать: \"Мы хотим пересаживать человеку\nорганы от свиньи\". Они сказали: \"У нас есть страдающее меньшинство,\nкоторым надо есть стейки\". И в решении FDA в конце двадцатого года\nили двадцать первого года было сказано, что мы предлагаем попробовать кормить людей таким мясом геномодифицированных\nсвиней.

А это значит, что во флоре у людей, которые будут есть это мясо, тоже будут\nэти гены.

И там используется мясо коров, которое в Китае выращивается на вкомицине.\nА дальше во флоре хозяев собак, которые едят эти влажные корма, уже есть гены\nэтой резистентности. И этих людей нельзя будет вылечить антибиотиками. И мы про это говорили в прошлый раз. И в\nпятидесятом году больше людей будет умирать от супербактерии, чем от рака.\nА от рака будет много умирать людей, потому что человечество будет стареть. И это большая проблема.

И он обманул этих родителей. Он за это сел в тюрьму. И мы\nзнаем, что а как минимум две таких девочки есть. Мы не знаем, что с их здоровьем. Но есть причина, почему я\nсейчас решил вернуться к этой истории. Я слежу за его твиттером. А он он вышел из тюрьмы 2 года назад. Э срок был\nнебольшой. И вообще Китай явно им гордится. Угу. При том, что научное сообщество очень плохо к нему относится.\nПо всему понятно, что, ну, не говоря про глубокую безравственность этого эксперимента и обман этих семей, они не\nпонимали, в чём они участвуют. Понятно также, что он, скорее всего, не достиг своей цели. Я сейчас чуть-чуть подробнее\nпро это расскажу. Это было довольно тяп-ляп сделано. Но из интересного он работает снова в Пекине, и у него\nбольшая пастава в Твиттере, и он занимается медицинской генетикой. И вот эту картинку я увидел на днях буквально\nу него в Твиттере, где он пишет, что генетическая редактура - это будущее человечество, и себя явно изображает в\nвиде пророка, который выводит людей из какого-то скотского состояния в состоянии генетической\nотредактированности, что с разных точек зрения чудовищно. Отдельно впечатляет, что ему пишут\nфанаты, что если у вас технически есть эта возможность, то безнравственно не попробовать,\nпотому что вы можете избавить человечество от страдания. А процитирую математика Фрэнсиса\nГальтона, который был родоначальником евгеники и идеи улучшения людей больше\n100 лет назад. Всем известно, что евреи скупы, а женщины не видят ближе своего носа. И наш долг найти гены этих свойств\nи избавить мира от порока. А и дальше произошло то, что произошло в Третьем рейхе и их идеи евгеники. На\nсамом деле этот разговор никуда не ушёл, и он будет продожать перед нами маячить, поскольку а-а прогресс продолжает идти\nвперёд, и мы продолжаем в меру своего понимания на сегодня. Нам кажется диким и наивным и шовинистическим взгляд\nгальтона. Меру своего понимания. Мы сегодня что-нибудь думаем про страдания людей, как надо от него избавлять. Но\nодна из вещей, которая обсуждается - это защита от вирусов. Потому что нам грозят новые пандемии, лечение, вот, скажем, от\nВИЧ. Так, чтобы исцелить человека. Нас пока что в руках нету, хотя очень хорошо работает терапия, но\nесть другие вирусы, которые нас заботят гораздо больше. А и есть, скажем, свиньи, которым вшито с самого начала\nзащита от каких-то важных вирусов, и это помогает свиноводству, да? А поэтому\nэтот вопрос всё время встаёт. А, но я сегодня расскажу про несколько случаев,\nкогда людям редактируют гены, так что это не передастся в череде поколений.

В действительности, когда\nначалась эпидемия пандемия вещь, стало понятно, что в мире есть люди, которые\nот природы кинетически защищены от этого вируса. Сначала их нашли на каких-то редких\nостровах, а потом стало понятно, что в Северной Европе их довольно заметная концентрация, скажем, в Норвегии может\nбыть 15% людей. Речь идёт вот о чём. Я сейчас попробую руками изображать вирусы\nи клетки. Ну вирус ВИЧ атакует клетки иммунитета, и этим он чудовищен.\nТого самого иммунитета, который должен защищать от вирусов. А, истно, что когда он должен прицепиться к клетке, ну, в\n1.000 раз меньше клетки, он находит на ней такие специальные застёжки, на которые он садится, некий рецептор,\nкоторый зачем-то этим клеткам нужен. И этот рецептор записан где-то в ДНК,\nв генах. Он передаётся в череде поколений. Как делать вот эти застёжки? Они для чего-то нужны. И вот оказалось, что есть люди, у\nкоторых стёрто 32 буквы в геноме из 3 млрд букв. Поэтому эта мутация называется дельта 32 без трид.\nИ у этих людей нет этих рецепторов. Представь себе лысый лимфоцит. И он не может зацепиться, они не\nзаражаются. И у Джанкой была идея. Он думал, раз наш редактор уже есть, он уже работает, есть\nКрис Парка9, что бы нам такое починить в людях? Ну и в этом смысле очень естественная логика, что проще\nчто-нибудь сломать, проще стереть эти 32 буквы. когда разразился скандал и его стали\nсажать в тюрьму и его прокляло всё международное сообщество, стали вообще разбираться с этой мутации,\nи, кажется, она ухудшает твои шансы при столкновении с какими-то другими вирусами.

Так, а раз ему нужна пересадка костного мозга,\nто есть мы сожжём ему его костный мозг перед пересадкой, и он не будет делать свои лимфоциты,\nто почему бы нам не взять тогда для него трансплантат от человека с такой мутацией, и он тогда будет производить\nего клетки крови, которые будут защищены от вечи. И на самом деле вот сейчас мы узнали про\nседьмого такого пациента. Тот первый пациент, с ним такая была история, он умирал от рака, ему трансплантаном\nвылечили рак, и оказалось, что он свободен от веч. Сейчас мы говорим про седьмого пациента,\nи это, мне кажется, генная редактора здорового человека. Это вот была геннаредактора курильщика.

Если они видят там старые клетки, хозяина, они просто убивают их всех быстрее, чем они\nуспевают заразиться ВИЧ. Так что история казалась сложнее. Э-э, эээ, но, а, я\nхотел просто передать привет Хиджанку и сказать, что мы пока что обойдёмся без его вот этой Евгеники. А пока что есть\nэта чудесная история про трансплантацию костного мозга.

Но вот такого я не слышала. В этом году, э,\nЖенщина-химера: тест ДНК показал мужскую кровь\nучёные узнали про женщину, которая сдаёт анализ крови, а он мужской.\nО боже, она химера. У неё весь костный мозг от её брата близнеца, только он существует. Она его не поглотила, как в других\nисториях, он существует. Она сдаёт анализы крови мужчины и своего брата.\nА, и мне показалось как-то чудесный анекдот. Как это вообще вот будет как раз влиять на рождение детей дальнейшее и всё\nостальное? Да. А, ну, её дети - это её дети, она их рожает нормально. А я не помню, был ли\nтам какой-то иммунный конфликт с ними. По-моему, не было. Но это, конечно, сюрприз, что ты сдаёшь анализ крови. Он\nне просто не твой, он ещё и мужской. Слушай, потому что ты сказал один\nвопрос. Мы когда-то делали программу про грудное вскармливание. И там же есть такой элемент, что мамочки целуют своих\nдетей каким-то образом, чувствуют там, не знаю, как это правильно сказать, иммунные клетки или ещё что-то, что происходит с организмом ребёнка. И у\nматери в молоке производятся какие-то защитные антитела. Антитела. И когда она кормит ребёнка,\nона может бы сама болеть, а ребёнок при этом не она получает его антитела от этой от этой от неё не получает этих\nвирусов. И ребёнок всё это там 2 недели мама болеет, а ребёнок всё это время здоров. Что-то подобное. Можно\nиспользовать вот этот механизм как-то для борьбы человека с вирусами в принципе?\nНу, ты услышишь это от любого врача. Я правда не знаю, были ли крупные исследования, насколько это точно\nподтверждается действительно реальной статистикой. Но есть распространённые\nсреди врачей поверье и убеждение, что в грудном молоке есть антитела. Это может давать какую-то защиту ребёнку в момент\nинфекции и может нейтрализовать вирусы. Да. А можно ли использовать эээ грудное\nмолоко как фабрику антител или то, что каким образом я там целуя\nребёнка, получая информацию, тут же произвожу.

У нас у нас был выпуск\nээ ровно про людей из этого же Пенсильванского университета. Угу. которые 15 лет назад разрабатывали\nвпервые терапию против рака, которая называется карте лимфоци, когда у\nчеловека берут его а костный мозг, его клетки крови, находят там т-киллеров,\nмне кажется, все слышали про те-киллеров во время пандемии, к-клеточный ответ, тклеточный иммунитет, и\nперепрограммирует их так, чтобы они убивали его рак. И тогда вот 15 лет назад, на самом деле\nуже, наверное, 20, я брал интервью у этих учёных. Они вылечили первых четырёх взрослых\nпациентов, у которых были уже килограммы метастазов, и они выжили. И позже была 10 лет спустя\nбыла пресс-конференция здесь, в Лондоне, на которой я был 10 лет этой терапии. Сейчас это уже 11 стран и тысячи\nвыличных пациентов. И вот у нас есть выпуск подкаста Голый землекоп, а, который называется\n\"Клетки особого назначения\". И там абсолютно слезоточивая история про девочку, которая была первым ребёнком,\nкоторого спасли. И им повезло, что они жили в Пенсильвании. И в тот день пришли буквально к врачам, когда у них как раз\nбыл вопрос, кого брать в этот гранд. И эта девочка была чуть не убита этой терапией и выжила. Эмили, её зовут, и\nпотрясающая книжка. Так что да, тут точим права.\nСамые интересные научные итоги года - это всегда не то, что планировали найти, а то, что нашли, как бы случайно. Искали\nлекарство от одной болезни, обнаружили лечение для другой, опровергли гипотезу, но открыли новое направление\nисследований. В кино такие неожиданные повороты называются твистами. Герои ждут\nодного, получают другое, и это переворачивает весь смысл истории. Но\nхороший твист - это не просто сюрприз. Он должен быть неожиданным и одновременно неизбежным, как в науке.\nДанные всегда были в эксперименте, просто никто не обращал на них внимания. Так и в хорошей истории. Зритель\nоглядывается назад и понимает, все подсказки были на виду. Просто он смотрел не туда.

Давай. А это всё будут этически выдержанные\nпримеры. Ты помнишь это кино про доктора Хаоса? Да. И его помощницу тринадцатую.\nТы помнишь её проблемы со здоровьем? Её мать умерла от болезни Хинсинктона, и\nона наследуется в 100% случаев, и она знала, что ей это грозит. А это чудовищное проклятие, потому что, а, это\nочень медленно развивающееся неврологическое заболевание. Ты видел, как умирают старшие члены семьи, но ты\nне знаешь, когда оно у тебя начнётся, в 40 лет, в 50 или в 60. И оно начинается небыстро, с некоторого нарушения\nмоторного контроля. И ты не знаешь, вот ты разбил чашку по этому или у тебя ещё 15 лет впереди.\nУхудшение эмоциональной сферы, но у тебя может быть просто плохое настроение, а может быть это оно уже началось с депрессии, а\nдальше оно продолжает развиваться, идёт такая деградация нервной системы, человек умирает. И мы любим говорить про\nгенную терапию, когда учёные смогли отредактировать какие-нибудь гены. Но а\nпроникнуть в мозг со всей этой историей чрезвычайно сложно. Мозг отделён от всего остального организма. барьером,\nгематоэнцефалическим барьером. Если бы наш иммунитет увидел бы мозг и нервную систему, он бы его атаковал, потому что\nон не понимает, что это что это не что-то чужае. Угу. А есть примеры, когда у человека\nкакое-нибудь заболевание, наследственное, оно хорошо изученное, и у него там в печени накапливаются неправильные метаболиты, и это портит\nтам всё. А ему вкалывают, делают укол, это прозрачная жидкость, но там есть\nкриспор9, который отредактирует гены в печени. Есть примеры таких пациентов.\nНо в истории, которой я хочу рассказать, британская это американское исследование, но это были британские\nпациенты в британской больнице. Группа учёных почти сутки проводила\nхирургическую операцию для того, чтобы добраться со своим катетером точно в то место в мозге, где накапливаются эти\nнеправильные метаболиты, где происходит эта поломка. Это хорошо известное\nзаболевание. Знаешь, люди вообще плохо знают медицинскую генетику человека, потому что на человеке нельзя делать\nэкспериментов, в отличие от мух и мышей. Но какие-нибудь вот такие заболевания,\nпередающиеся по наследству с очень яркой клиникой, они довольно хорошо изучены. А\nи понятно, что там происходит.

И из-за этого они производят некий\nнеправильный белок вместо правильного, и он накапливается и забивает клетки\nмозга, и они гибнут. И суть состоит в том, что они смогли добраться до нужного\nучастка, ещё раз почти сутки со своим катетером на открытом мозге, и они смогли доставить туда инструкцию по\nпроизводству правильного белка и так, чтобы победить эту проблему. Причём, как\nвыяснилось, это произошло уже 3 года назад, и это некоторая группа пациентов, и в течение 3х лет можно было их\nнаблюдать. И было видно, что у них остановились симптомы развития заболевания. Они могут читать книги, они\nмогут делать то, что они хотели. Они типа втрое снизили темпы развития заболевания. И я читал про всё это в\nсентябре, когда это было большой новостью. Здесь вот в UK писали все газеты. Я увидел\nкомментарии членов семей, людей из сообщества с болезнью Континктона. Просто вот в Ютбе, например,\nкакой-нибудь выпуск новостной, и там сотни комментариев. И это невозможно читать без слёз, потому что\nаэ вот ей пишет там мама, у нас двое детей, вот наш папа, отец семьи, видел,\nкак умирали все старшие члены семьи. Он с ним это будет происходить. И у нас появилась надежда. И в ноябре мы узнали,\nчто FDA остановил это исследование. И следующей фазы не будет пока что. Почему?\nА в этом году очень много чего остановилось замороженое из американских исследований. А конкретно эти даже\nнельзя сказать, что попали под Трампа. Там есть очень хитрая методологическая загвоздка. Я не знал\n\"Фальшивые\" операции вместо плацебо\nэтого раньше, но на людях в таких исследованиях делают фальшивые операции для контрольной группы. Вот у нас был\nвыпуск подкаста Голыхе земляков, где мы говорили про головную боль. И там был метод, связанный с тем, что при\nнекоторых сортах головной боли можно носить такие разрезы на скальп, перерезая нервы кожи, которые могут\nиметь очень хороший результат для некоторой группы, для части людей, у которых головная боль определённого типа. И чтобы это узнать, учёные\nпрооперировали 5.000 человек, из которых в половине сделали фальшивую операцию\nSurgery для того, чтобы это был настоящий честный контроль. Для того, чтобы могли фальшиву они как бы это значит, что они наносили разрезы, но\nне человека, который не нуждался. Нет, они брали всех людей, которые нуждались в операции. Они подписывали\nсогласие, что есть шанс пятидесятипроцентный, что аа их операция будет фальшивой. Это значит,\nчто им под наркозом тоже наносили разрезы, тоже на скальп, но не перерезали нервы, а шли по каким-то\nслучайным линем. И в этом только в таком исследовании можно увидеть, что дело не в плацебо.\nПонятно. Плацебо в последние десятилетия работает всё сильнее и сильнее на людях. Это точно неизвестно почему.\nИ оказывается, существует практика таких фальшивых операций. То есть люди сознательно на это идут ради науки.\nЕдинственное, на что они могут рассчитывать, это если потом вы",

Это слишком опасно и слишком серьёзно, например, сделать всё это же, но,\nскажем, не вкалывать генную терапию. Это слишком радикально. И FDA на этом сейчас\nостановила это исследование, сказав, что просто сравнение с другими пациентами, которые не получили операцию, не\nявляется достаточно надёжным. Одно небольшое, ты говоришь, сутки они пытались добраться с помощью катетера к\nэтому месту. Это на что уходит время?

Оченьочень долгая\nоперация.

А нам всем, может быть, поставят и\nинструментом доставки этой генетической инструкции являлся вирус. Человеку поставили в мозг вирус, как вот в\nкомпьютере бывают вирус. Доставить этот вирус заняло сутки, но этот вирус донёс нужную генетическую инструкцию, и люди\nсмогу снова смогли читать книги. И главное, что у них был прогноз очень быстрого развития этого болезни.

А бюджет Национального института здравоохранения, самого большого биомедицинского центра,\nкогда я последний раз проверял, был равен бюджету страны Россия. А правда, это было вот до совсем такого\nнефтяного богатства, но это очень большие деньги.

Я видела её на одной из встреч\nи не понимала в этот момент, что на самом деле это один из таких ключевых моз мозгов этой этой лаборатории, потому\nчто она была довольно немногословна. Угу. А сейчас это имя, наверное, все слышали. Её зовут Ксения Петрова. Это её\nрабочее место. А это она сама? Да, она везла.\nОна большую часть этого года провела в тюрьме. Ей грозит большой срок, что самая страшная выдача в России. Она\nвезла лягушачью икру, если называть вещи своими именами. А и она она поехала на\nконцерт замечательного пианиста Андреса Шифа в Париж, потому что она миломан. И на обратном пути, поскольку у них есть\nпартнёрство с французской группой, она взяла лягушачьие эмбрионы. Вы все видели эти лягушачьие эмбрионы в луже, когда\nвот вы идёте мимо лужи, это просто лягушачья икра, к тому же убитая, что ещё очень важно. И они смотрели в\nтаможенные правила, когда они думали над тем, как с этим поступить. А\nим было видно, что ничто сделанное из лягушки не может представлять биологической угрозы и не должно\nпроводиться как биоматериал, потому что у людей, у млекопитающих, не бывают болезни лягушек.\nУгу. Это не может быть биопасностью, да? Тем более, что это убитая икра, это зафиксированные эмбрионы. И их проблема\nбыла в том, что когда их отправляешь по почте, то оно всё размораживается и дохнет. И она со складогентом везла в\nнадежде, что всё уцелеет. И последнее, что произошло, это, приближаясь вот к этому рубежу, через\nкоторый, может быть, многие, кто нас сейчас смотрит, ну, не знаю, возили какие-нибудь вкусные помидоры, вяленые помидоры из Европы, да, или что-то, что\nмы привезли родственникам в Нью-Йорк.

А учёные в этом смысле представляют дополнительную угрозу. И\nтам было масса историй, когда учёный из Франции едет на конференцию, у него залезли в телефон и\nнашли что-то в соцсетях и развернули. Достаточно одной такой истории, чтобы люди все очень сильно задумались, да, и\nсо мной если они не писали бы лишнего в соцсетях, кто бы подумал, что в XXI веке про Америку можно услышать такое\nсловосочетание.

И опять же Путин Сидзеньпиним обсуждал,\nкак они будут жить долго и счастливо, ремонтируя то один орган, то второй. Это\nтолько Россия и Китай этим озабочена или другие страны сегодня тоже? Ну, здесь есть фундаментальная научная\nпроблема. Действительно, учёных очень интересует, как устроено старение. И на моих глазах за эти вот последние\nдесятилетия я видел конкуренцию двух основных как бы взглядов. Один, состоящий в том, что старение - это\nнекий единый биологический процесс, который как-то специально запускается организмом, чтобы убить самого себя. И\nэто что-то, что запрограммировано в генах для того, чтобы сменять поколение, чтобы старики, вот всякие диктаторы не\nзаживали век молодых. И это романтическое представление. А такой самурайской гипотеза, согласно\nкоторой организм добивает себя сам, чтобы не нести мутации в популяцию дальше и прокручивать поколение.\nРомантическая в том смысле, что если мы найдём эту одну кнопку, то мы научимся её выключать. Угу.\nА, но скептики говорят скорее, что, может быть, этой кнопки не существует и может быть мы её не увидим. И, может\nбыть, организм стареет не по одной причине, а по тысячам причин.

А я думаю, что можно себе представить,\nчто в Китае будут органы, например, свины на запчасти.\nЯ представляю себе, что это будет происходить в Америке. Мы с тобой про это говорим уже много лет.

Видимо, у него какой-то есть double thing в голове, что с одной стороны, да,\nэто всё так, но может быть какой-то будет выхлоп, который вот только для пацанов, да, который только для\nчетвёртого управления медицинского, как было это в советское время.

Ну, ты знаешь хоть один хороший пример в истории, я не знаю, когда вот в таких секретных лабораториях\nчто-то такое глобальное родилось и пошло потом в мир? Нет, это всегда шарлатанство. Это всегда\nпахнет заверту шарлатанством по очень простой причине. Даже если туда каких-то достойных учёных наймут, учёные очень\nпохожи на людей, и человек в целом наврёт и и украдёт ровно столько, сколько ему дадут.\nИ это этого не происходит там, где есть слепая экспертиза, где всё, что люди\nделают, они должны отстаивать перед судом независимых, недоброжелательных рецензентов раз в какое-то время. А я\nпомню, я был сидел в архиве, а, по-моему, Медицинской академии наук, там был один из институтов системы\nмедицинской академии наук. Я смотрю, пятьдесят второй год, и что-то происходит.

Очень многие потери, э,\nтрагичны и необратимы. Гибнут люди, и это очень страшно. Но про какие-то потери я подумал вот что, что вот мы все\nТост Ильи Колмановского: Приобретения через потери (морские коньки, летучие мыши и рыжие коты)\nнесли разные потери. У каждых есть свой какой-то опыт совладания с ними. Я как-то очень ясно понял, что для того,\nчтобы наступило что-нибудь хорошее, что-нибудь другое хорошее должно закончиться. Я подумал, что вот есть три\nнаучные новости, в которых я ясно вижу этот сценарий, когда потери оборачиваются крупными приобретениями. Я\nхочу их как бы в качестве такого тоста тебе предложить новогоднего.\nА первая история про любимейших мною животных - это такие карликовые морские\nконьки, которых ты тут не разглядишь. Они водятся на этих кораллах, на горганариях,\nно ты не разглядишь их, даже если уткнёшься в них носом. Я специально ездил на Филиппины их\nискать в одиннадцатом году, и гит буквально ткнул меня в них нос. Мне нужен был гит, потому что я знал, что я\nих не найду. Это вещь вот такого размера. А, которая абсолютно сливается с\nкораллом, на которых она живёт, потому что они ужасно милые. Я провёл с ними 80 минут, чтобы сделать фотографию,\nпотому что понятно, что их в упор невозможно разглядеть. Видно, что они\nживут среди веточек коралла. И эти веточки, это коралл - это колониальное животное. Он состоит из полипов.\nУгу. Но весь морской конёк покрыт такими пупырями, которые поразительно похожи на этих полипов. И их открыли в шестьдесят\nдевятом году. Абсолютно случайно. Понятно, что их невозможно было специально открыть. Просто кто-то собирал кораллы и нашёл в этих кораллах\nконьков.

Они\nони очень похожи на коралл, но в этом году впервые прочитали их полный геном, так\nи при помощи нейросетей смогли внимательно разглядеть, что там произошло. И суть состояется в том, что\nэто точное огромное приобретение через потерю. Он просто потерял большие куски генома. И когда оттуда выпадали куски,\nон потерял всё. У него осталась половина морды. Он очень маленький, он просто не развивается из эмбриона. Он поэто\nмаленький такой, потому что он недалеко ушёл от эмбриона. Там все программы развития порушены. В частности, вот\nкакая важная программа. Я не знаю, считаете ли вы большим достижением, что пока вы живёте и обновляются ваши руки,\nваши ноги, ваша кожа, что всюду не вырастают ваши клоны, что из вас не лезут ваши клоны,\nчто клетки кожи знают, что им надо делать кожу, а не целую иру заново. И у\nтебя замечательная обновлённая постоянно кожа, а не клоны игры, где было бы кости,\nхрящи. Это значит вот что, что с какого-то момента, когда эмбриональные программы,\nгенетические программы работают, работают, работают, важнейшая часть развития - это разные блокировки, это в\nразные тормоза и стопоры. И теперь у меня в руке застопорены всякие гены развития сердца и хрящей, ушей и носа. И\nна руке не вырастает ни сердце, ни нос, потому что там заблокированы Угу. программы развития эмбриона.\nА оказалось, что у него они сломаны, э, эти эти тормоза. Не полностью, но достаточно для того, чтобы по всему ему\nтелу начинали расти небольшие его клоны. Эти пупыри - это небольшие клоны этого\nморского конька. Не очень большие, но ровно такие, чтобы они были похожи на\nполипа. Угу. И он просто покрыт такими небольшими своими клонами, и это делает его\nнеуязвимым. Там ещё есть целая история о том, что у них выпала вся ветвь тклеточного иммунитета. И это важно,\nпотому что у них беременные самцы. И эта беременность довольно интимная в том смысле, что это не просто икринку\nвынашивать где-то под хвостом, как делают многие рыбы, да, а у них что-то вроде плаценты прорастает. и их иммунитет атаковал бы\nэтого детёныша. У нас он не атакует в силу очень хитро придуманные плаценты, а у них просто выпала вся ветвь это\nклеточного иммунитета, поэтому они не атакуют своих собственных детей. Одним словом, это куча разных потерь, которые\nприобрели к приобретению. Ты согласна? Да. И вообще мне нравится, как они\nкак-то так, знаешь, какое-то перекликание с нашими вот народными свистульками. Я не знаю.\nКонец нашей судьбой.

Это основа вообще жизни на суше, что у тебя есть пальцы,\nтам работают специальные гены. Но выяснилось, что среди нас есть млекопитающие, у которых выпал этот\nкусок генома. У них не работает эта программа. А это значит, что когда развиваются пальцы, среж ними остаётся\nбольшая перепонка. И внимание, эти млекопитающие взмыли воздух, потому что\nони приобрели крылья.

Но когда они получили 3.000 геномов, скормили их своим нейросетям, они поняли, что когда-то там произошла\nутрата. в целом каскаде генов, которые отвечают за выработку коричневой краски меланина.\nИ таким образом получил преимущество, необычный мутантный способ производства вот этой чудесной рыжей краски. И мы\nзнаем теперь, почему у нас есть рыжие кошки. Я думаю, это главная новость года, потому что когда-то их предки потеряли какое-то количество букв ТНК.\nКак многие герои сегодняшнего разговора, да, как люди устойчивые квитч, как морские коньки,\nпотери, пускай все потери, которые кто-нибудь понёс в этом году, обернутся приобретениями рыжего цвета.\nВсех с Новым годом.
